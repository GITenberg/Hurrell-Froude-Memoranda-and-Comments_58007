<h3 class="p4 h3head">PREFACE</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">THE epistolary matter in the first section of this volume
is drawn from material already in print: chiefly from
Part <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> of <cite>The Remains of the Reverend Richard Hurrell
Froude, <abbr title="Master of Arts">M.A.</abbr>, Fellow of Oriel</cite>, published by the Rivingtons in
1838, and, incidentally, from <cite>John Henry Newman: Letters
and Correspondence to 1845</cite>, published by the Longmans in
1890: from one notable work, that is to say, which is wholly
forgotten, and from another yet recent, of great and unique
interest, which has not yet won its full public appreciation.
For the unrestricted use of the desired extracts from these
books, the Editor’s grateful thanks are due equally to the
representatives of the elder branch of the Froude family, and
to Cardinal Newman’s literary executor.</p>

<p>The liberal selection from Hurrell Froude’s Letters which
appeared in the <cite>Remains</cite> is invalidated, to modern curiosity,
by manifold suppressions and omissions necessary for private
reasons then in force. Some clue, however, is to be found,
if it be looked for, towards the identification of those to whom
his correspondence was addressed. The Editors of the <cite>Remains</cite>
silently adopted, for the Letters, the same system of differentiation
as they had already employed, two years before, in regard
to the authorship of the collected poems in <cite>Lyra Apostolica</cite>:
that is to say, in both books <ins title="gamma">γ</ins> stands for Keble, <ins title="delta">δ</ins> for Newman,
<ins title="epsilon">ε</ins> for Robert Wilberforce, and <ins title="zeta">ζ</ins> for Isaac Williams. As
Hurrell Froude’s own contributions to the <cite>Lyra</cite> had appeared
over the signature <ins title="beta">β</ins>, it was easy to surmise that <i>Beta</i> in the
<cite>Remains</cite> might refer to his brothers or sisters, and <i>Alpha</i>, by
a sort of primacy, to his father: as is certainly the case. But
it was more difficult, for instance, to identify <ins title="eta">η</ins> as Mr. Frederic
Rogers, or <ins title="theta">θ</ins> as the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Frederick Christie: for to these
<!--014.png--><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii"></a><span class="pageno">xii</span>
there was no key but that of internal evidence of an elusive
sort. The Greek alphabet, in the <cite>Remains</cite>, served only as a
heading to marshal the recipients of the Letters written by
Froude; proper names figuring in the course of the Letters
were almost in every instance replaced by a blank. The verification
of these names will perhaps be accepted, though not
all are based on a manuscript reading;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span> and of course no
blank has been filled experimentally without due indication
of that process. Nor has effort been made, at any point, to
fill out sentences, or gaps of any kind, save those caused by
the suppression of proper names. This line of procedure, and,
indeed, the entire scheme of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">rifacciamento</i>, stands subject
first and last to the circumstance that the Editor has had no
access to the great mass of dated and classified manuscript
correspondence now at Edgbaston. As it was impossible to
collate the Froude-Newman Letters with the originals, there
appeared something supererogatory in reprinting any of the
others in their complete form, or including unpublished addenda
most kindly placed at the Editor’s disposal, when an exception
had to be ruled in regard to the most interesting and
most important material of all. Unfortunately, moreover,
Froude’s letters to his father, the Archdeacon, to Robert
Wilberforce and to Isaac Williams, have perished; and those
to Mr. Keble, if existent, had not been recovered by his grandnephew,
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> George C. Keble, at the time when this
volume went to press. A few letters have been pieced together
by comparison of passages, as they stand in the <cite>Remains</cite>, and
in the Newman <cite>Correspondence</cite>, issued a half-century later.
Examination of the fac-simile page of the amusing letter from
Barbados, written on December 26, 1834, and of its counterpart
in the text here given, copied from that of the <cite>Remains</cite>,
will show that some de-editing might be called for, under the
right conditions, in the matter of Hurrell Froude’s edited
correspondence. It will be seen, on the whole, that neither
close study nor long acquaintance with the subject could keep
<!--015.png--><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii"></a><span class="pageno">xiii</span>
the reprinting, as it pressed forward, from degenerating into
more or less of a game of guesswork. Yet exclusions and
limitations may cast a befitting half-light upon used literature
of long ago, which was in itself elliptical, and tends to create
new ellipses, inasmuch as its purpose now is to throw stress less
on historic or theological issues than on human character.
Many given data, or few, yield pretty much the same residuum
when the personality which reigns over them is as rich and
strong as Hurrell Froude’s. Says one of the most penetrating
of modern writers:</p>

<p>‘The art of biography has accustomed those who read
to expect … as the word implies, the portrayal of a life, of a
process: the record of the growth and unfolding of a soul and
character. This it is which interests the subjective temper of
our days…. Our mind has learnt that its choicest food need
not be sought from afar, but lies scattered with the wild flowers
by the wayside, and that nothing is so extraordinary as the
ordinary. Thus we have come to care less for a full inventory
of the events which make up a man’s life, or for the striking
nature of those events in themselves, than for such a judicious
selection and setting of them as shall best bring out and
explain that individuality which is our main interest. We
care less for what a man does and more for what he is; and
it is mainly as a key to what he is that we study the circumstances
which act upon him, and the conduct by which he
reacts upon them.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> A selection and setting to explain individuality:
such is the aim, such (it is to be feared) is only
very partially the achievement, of this book.</p>

<p>Concerning its second section a few remarks may be called
for. That section actually had, from the first, in the Editor’s
intention, the right of way. It is quite independent, not called
into auxiliary play as a mere illustrative collection of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pièces
justificatives</i>. Many of these essays and reviews have authority;
a few have great literary beauty; the Editor’s work, which
could not vie with them, has borrowed almost nothing from
them, and thus preserved two integrities. Although limits of
space forbade the reproduction of any one chapter of appreciable
<!--016.png--><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv"></a><span class="pageno">xiv</span>
length quite in its entirety, yet there existed no reason,
but only the whim of artistic choice, for the inclusion or exclusion
of one part of any paper at the cost of another part.
The process of making excerpts, at best, has something of
disagreeableness and of danger. Where that process cannot
be avoided, it is well, at least, if its lever be not a preconceived
theory. An Editor not of Froude’s own religious communion
should scruple all the more to interfere in any wise with the
witnesses. Such lines or pages as are here scored out are not
inaccessible in their original forms. It will be seen that
they are not deleted to favour any special plea, but are either
somewhat irrelevant to the subject in hand, or a repetition of
facts and impressions more succinctly stated in other accompanying
papers. Where aught of moment is involved, the
fullest and clearest expression of it is in every case allowed
to carry the field: <i>e.g.</i>, Dean Church’s apologetics concerning
Froude’s so-called ‘Romanising’ will be found more satisfactory
to the uneasy than the paler defence in the first Preface to the
<cite>Remains</cite>. A broad selective principle has ruled the Editor
also in minor matters: <i>e.g.</i>, a poem of Froude’s own, imbedded
in the text of an early review by Lord Blachford, or a poem of
his great friend’s imbedded in an analysis by Mr. R. H. Hutton,
are, though coveted, left where they are, and are not transferred
to the main narrative sketch. A slight overlapping, as it were,
is inevitable: what is super-serviceable sometimes serves more
than one pen. Nothing written in English about Hurrell
Froude which has colour and individuality, has been altogether
passed by, though the present scheme is not in the least bibliographical.
On the whole, there is set forth a richly varied
testimony: comment buttressed on comment, sometimes, and
contradiction against contradiction. Everything about the
man calls for criticism, and gets it: his private examen of
conscience, his verses, his letters, his traditional sayings, his
ecclesiastical theory and religious practice; everything, in fact,
except his dreaded arguments. These are conspicuously let
alone by those who disapprove of them. They lurk, however,
beyond the borders of parley, and they constitute the aggressiveness
of one, who but for insistence on them, and whatever
they imply, was essentially courteous and gentle. By his commentators
<!--017.png--><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv"></a><span class="pageno">xv</span>
he is incessantly quoted: the ‘party of the second
part,’ whoever may be writing, successfully holds the stage.
It is always instructive to watch reflections of so simple and
boyish, yet powerful a personality, on the complex surface of
literary interpretation. We count Hurrell Froude’s a long-forgotten
name; yet during the sixty-eight years since he
died, more serious students than would seem at first thought
likely, have felt for this fighting recluse true attraction, or the
equally legitimate attraction of repulsion; and their number
bids fair to increase.</p>

<p class="unindent">The apprehension of all he was, if not the whole truth about
him, should be, in this synod of philosophical friends and
deeply interested foes, no difficult thing to win and hold.</p>

<p>It may not be usual to treat a man of genius like an unglossed
manuscript, and to set him forth impartially with all his
variants. As dear Izaak says in his innocent-seeming irony,
this is, perhaps, to impale him ‘as if you loved him.’ But
a free hearing is good law and good art; diverging guesses,
contrasted points of view, exercised by the competent, have
their uses, especially in England; and some natures and
motives bear analysis gallantly well. The reason, at bottom,
for so catholic a treatment of Hurrell Froude, is that Hurrell
Froude, with his singular detachment and sound humour,
would not have disclaimed it: that is, if he had come to
know that posterity would fain hear of him again. And
there is but one conclusion to be drawn from the spirited
discussions about him. As M. Henri Malo was pleased to
write, not so long ago, of his historic hero: ‘<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En somme,
quelle que soit l’opinion que l’on ait sur son compte, c’est une
figure!</cite>’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>The sole purpose of this unconventional yet homogeneous
volume is to show Froude, the mind and the man, in his inferential
<!--018.png--><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi"></a><span class="pageno">xvi</span>
completeness, and without primary reference to that
application of his best-cherished principles which meant so
much then, and which means so much now. Without primary
reference, we say: yet to part him by one hair’s breadth
from the Oxford Movement, who would, and who could? A
book which aims at being not a disquisition, not even a
biography, but simply a convenient rearrangement of obvious
data for the study of a temperament, may plead its own
voluntary poverty as a general extenuation. In the matter
not of exegesis but of mere quantity, no reader will complain
of too little!</p>

<p>The chronology of many of the footnotes has been
compiled from the <cite>Alumni Oxonienses</cite>, the <cite>Registrum
Orielense</cite>, and the <cite>Dictionary of National Biography</cite>. In a
book of this nature, appealing chiefly to those who know
by heart the golden commonplaces of the educated world,
it has not been thought pertinent to ‘overset’ or verify the
classical quotations.</p>

<p>Something may be added concerning the illustrations.
William Brockedon, before he was famous, once started to
paint a life-size head in oil of Hurrell, then aged about eleven.
It was left unfinished, and is now in the possession of the
young sitter’s namesake and nephew, R. H. Froude, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, of
Bernstein, Newton Abbot, by whose kindness a half-tone
‘restoration’ of it serves as frontispiece to this book. Outside
a casual pencil sketch, it is the only portrait at present
known of Hurrell Froude; nor has it ever before been reproduced,
save once as a small scratchy characterless detail of
a Keble College panorama. The painting was unfortunately
abandoned while in its half-chaotic condition: eyebrows
and ears are but barely indicated; the entire background, the
collar, a portion of the hair growing so wilfully on the large
shapely head, remarkable then and always for its even convexity,
are a mere disordered wash; and it was difficult to
follow, and to fix by process after process, a vision of the
beautiful boy, with his melancholy and his racial fire. No
idealisation, as need hardly be said, has been attempted.
Patience and sincerity, brought to a rather discouraging task,
have succeeded, in some measure, in recapturing an imperfect
<!--019.png--><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii"></a><span class="pageno">xvii</span>
image, and in having it recognised (so far as a man can be
recognised in a child), with gratified pleasure, by the one or
two known to the Editor who are the enviable rememberers
of Hurrell Froude. The reduction of the original head to an
almost miniature size justified itself at once in the disappearance
of many blemishes. The print from which the block
was made is an outcome of the photographic skill and artistic
feeling, now historic in England and beyond it, of Mr. Frederick
Hollyer. The ‘casual pencil sketch’ just mentioned figures also
in this book, and has in even higher degree the preciousness
of a unique thing: for the reproduction is made directly from
an unaltered original in a portfolio of 1832. Students of that
period in England will recall Miss Maria Giberne, the ‘Queen
of Tractaria,’ the animated, romantic, and loyal friend of the
Newmans, who followed her art with long devotion, and became,
later, Sister Maria Pia in the Visitation Convent at
Autun, where she died at a great age. Of her, in her early
prime, one who knew her well wrote:</p>

<p>‘[Maria Giberne] was always a most excellent talker and
narrator, but her great power lay in the portraits she did in
chalks. At a very short sitting, and even from memory, she
would draw a portrait which was at least perfectly and undeniably
true. I have heard her drawings criticised, and her
drapery called conventional, but her faces, to my apprehension,
were proof against all criticism. Perhaps they are better
in outline than when filled up and tinted…. Her interest
in the whole [Tractarian] circle was insatiable, and there was
hardly anything she would not do and dare for a sight of one
she had not yet seen.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Given, therefore, Miss Giberne’s ardour in the matter, and
her frequently-recurring opportunities as a visitor, it would
seem almost certain that she would not have let slip any chance
of portraying so noticeable a luminary as Hurrell Froude,
often absent, like herself, from Oxford, during 1831-1833, and
away from it almost altogether afterwards. Her discovered
sketch-books, preserved in the hands of relatives and friends,
yield, so far, but a single page in which Froude appears.
<!--020.png--><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii"></a><span class="pageno">xviii</span>
She groups and labels him with other conspirators’ at a historic
moment,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span> in the one Oxford Common Room which ‘stank
of logic.’ Something in the too quiescent gesture of the
graceful person ‘on the box,’ as well as in the nature of the
circumstance, make one suspect that the whole was drawn not
on the spot, nor from memory, but from hearsay at the time.
Were such the case, the implication would be that Miss
Giberne had a good prior knowledge of Froude’s face and
figure, and even that she was not committing these to paper
for the first time. This little drawing is the property of her
nephew, George Pearson, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, of Manchester; it is owing to
his courtesy and kindness that it is here made public.</p>

<p>The picture of Dartington Parsonage, the antique house
in the vale three miles from Totnes, Devonshire, where Hurrell
Froude was born, and where he died, is from a larger water-colour
drawing by Arthur Holdsworth Froude, in the possession
of his sister, the Baroness Anatole von Hügel. The Parsonage,
in its mediæval simplicity, was first sketched by Archdeacon
Froude, then the newly-appointed Rector, in 1799; this sketch
yet exists on a fly-leaf of the Parish records. He at once
rebuilt the whole west wing, planted shrubs and vines, and
drained away the pond; but there were no other alterations
until after his death and the removal of the family in
1859-60, when his grandson Arthur drew the house from
memory. Even now, the porch, and everything to the right of it,
upstairs and down, is practically the very same as in Hurrell’s
time; elsewhere the gables have disappeared, and the tourelle
has changed its place. The Parish Church (of fourteenth
century work, like the Hall) is from an old negative by
Messrs. Brinley and Son, of Totnes. This view from the
south-west shows the low railing over the Froude vault, which
lay in the angle of the porch, next the wall. The Church
being taken down in 1878, the strong plain Tower was left
alone and intact, standing sentinel over the dead; and the
large slab shown in the foreground of the modern photograph,
covering the burial-place of Hurrell Froude and of his kindred, is
<!--021.png--><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix"></a><span class="pageno">xix</span>
as it looks to-day. The print of Oriel College great quadrangle
is from a photograph copyrighted many years ago by Messrs.
Henry W. Taunt and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, of Oxford, and here used by their
permission. The inner top tier of three windows next the
angle of the Chapel marks the rooms occupied by Froude.
They are on the second floor of Staircase <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 3, the door
being at the right hand as one mounts the stairs. The beautiful
Porch and the whole front have since been renovated, and the
tall bold <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Regnante Carolo</i> again runs around the ruined open
stone-work parapet, shown in our illustration, which an Oriel
man of the Thirties saw every day as he went in and out
of Hall.</p>

<p>It remains only to thank the family of William Froude, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>,
and the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Charles Martin, the present Rector of Dartington;
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> G. Kenworthy, Vicar of Bassenthwaite, whose generosity
and knowledge have supplied the Editor with many
biographical data of the Spedding family; the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> T. Herbert
Bindley for authentic information about Codrington College;
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> J. Christie for much painstaking friendliness, and the
use of a page of one of the Theta letters for a fac-simile; the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> G. A. Williams, and several other kind correspondents
of Tractarian lineage, who have patiently answered inquiries.
Lastly, a more intimate acknowledgment is especially due
to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> W. H. Carey, of SS. Michael and All Angels,
Woolwich; for chiefly through the sense of his steady
encouragement, based on an enthusiasm for Hurrell Froude,
the Editor’s task, more than once interrupted and laid by,
was pushed on to its completion.</p>

of genius. On that ground they win the eye. Vital and

<p class="unindent">stands Newman’s early friend, Richard Hurrell Froude, the
lost Pleiad of the Oxford Movement. Akin to some others,
names earlier and later, ‘which carry a perfume in the mention,’
he left little to prove and approve himself. Such as he, in
the pageant of eternity, are not the tallest harvesters with
the most recognisable sheaves. Like Crichton and Falkland
and Pergolesi, like Arthur Hallam and Henri Perreyve, he is
known to history as it were by a smiling semi-private hint,
or a sort of May-orchard coronal which the wind has no
power to scatter, rather than by virtue of any personal innings
in the complex game of life. He was a mere man of genius.
His inheritance was richly varied: of mental currents possible
in one cross-bred island, there could hardly be a more spirited
blend. ‘The thinkers of the West,’ as an analytic pen has
lately written,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span>
‘reveal a certain practical sagacity, a determination
<!--026.png--><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><span class="pageno">2</span>
to see things clearly, a hatred of cant and shams,
a certain “positive” tendency which is one of the notes of
purely English thought.’ Exact in the wider application, the
sentence has an almost startling appropriateness when it is
narrowed down to fit the one ‘thinker of the West’ (not
in Mr. Ellis’s lists) with whom these pages deal. Never to
maunder, never to mince matters, never to pet an illusion,
never to lay down arms while there are ‘cant and shams’
to fight,&mdash;all that is very Devonian; and Hurrell Froude,
true at every point, was true Devon in this. His ancestral
Speddings, on the other hand, had imagination and a love of
letters, and were ironic and opinionative after another fashion.
They had also, for generation after generation, as an unexpected
corollary, a strong turn for science, and even for
mechanical science, as the less bookish Froudes, to offset their
hard common sense, were restless and romantic lovers of the
open air and of the sea. The shy, critical, solitary, but
ardent and adventurous character which belonged not only
to our particular Fellow of Oriel, but in some measure to all
his nearest kindred, seems to have been inherited equally from
the contrasted streams which ran in their blood. All Hurrell’s
religiousness, all his poetry and fire and penetrative thought,
came straight from his beautiful and highly intelligent mother,
whom he lost just as he really came to know her, and whom
he worshipped during the rest of his life. His stature, colour,
and expression, as also his delicacy of constitution, he received
through her.</p>

<p>The Speddings were Anglo-Irish, migrating during the
sixteenth century to Scotland, then, early in James <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></span>’s time,
to Cumberland. John Spedding and his wife Margaret were
seated at Armathwaite Hall, in Bassenthwaite parish, Keswick,
when their second daughter Margaret, afterwards Mrs. Froude,
was born in 1774. Her elder sister Mary, her brothers John,
James, Anthony, and William (in order of their age), comprised
with her, her father’s family; and she was but seven
when he died. Armathwaite Hall was left in the hands of
trustees, who so wasted it that when John Spedding, the son,
came of age he found his patrimony gone, and resolved to
leave the country to join the army, then in the thick of the
<!--027.png--><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><span class="pageno">3</span>
Peninsular War. Meanwhile, four miles away, at the head of
Bassenthwaite Lake lay Mirehouse, the owner of which was
Thomas Story, Esquire, a bachelor, attached to his Spedding
neighbours. In the most opportune and romantic way, he
made young John Spedding his heir, just in time to prevent his
self-imposed exile, and in 1802 died, and was succeeded by
him in the estate. It was thus that the Speddings, who had
occupied Armathwaite Hall for over a century, came ultimately
to live at the other end of the Lake. John Spedding married
Miss Sarah Gibson of Newcastle. They lived to old age, and
had a numerous issue. James Spedding, the distinguished
scholar, the intimate friend of Tennyson, and leader of the
famous Cambridge set ‘The Apostles,’ known afterwards in
the world of letters as the vindicator of Bacon, was their third
son. He spent most of his life (1808-1881) at Mirehouse,
and is buried not far away, in the old churchyard of
Bassenthwaite. He and his knew all the Froudes well; visits
were constantly interchanged; and it was he who introduced
James Anthony Froude, his cousin, and brother-in-law at one
remove, as it were, to Carlyle. For James Spedding’s eldest
brother, Thomas Story Spedding, married his cousin Phillis
Froude, the second daughter of the household at Dartington.</p>

<p>To revert to the elder generation&mdash;Margaret Spedding, her
own mother’s namesake, born, as we have seen, in 1774, was
dearly loved at home for seven and twenty years; at that somewhat
mature age (as it was considered in 1802), she married
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Robert Hurrell Froude, Rector of Dartington in Devonshire.
His own people were not less interesting, and even
more ancient, than hers. Hurrells, an armigerous family, and
Froudes, rising yeomen from Kent, had struck deep and wide
roots in Devon soil at least as early as the reign of Elizabeth.
The second of these was probably a place-name, though there
are those who derive it from the Icelandic <dfn>frod</dfn>, wise, not
from the likelier Celtic <dfn>ffrwd</dfn>, a rushing stream.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span> We find
the race numerous and active, and settled chiefly about
<!--028.png--><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pageno">4</span>
Kingston, and about Modbury, where in the year of Culloden,
Richard Hurrell, gentleman, was married to Mistress Phillis<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_8" id="fnanchor_8"></a><a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span>
Collings. Their daughter, Phillis Hurrell, became the wife of
Robert ffroud of Walkhampton, third son of John, to whom
descended the Modbury manors of Edmerston and Gutsford;
these two lived at Aveton Giffard, and are buried there in the
Parish Church, where their monuments still exist. ‘Robert
ffroud Armiger’ died young, four years after his marriage,
which had for issue one son, and three daughters. Phillis the
widow, a person of strong character, lived on for sixty-six
years longer, and saw the grave opened, or opening, for nearly
all her brilliant and fated grandchildren. Her babes, left
fatherless in 1770, were Mary, Margaret, and Elizabeth; her
son Robert Hurrell was a posthumous child. The latter was
to rise to more than local eminence, known throughout an
exceptionally long life as Rector of Dartington, and from
1820 on, as Archdeacon of Totnes in the diocese of Exeter.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_9" id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span>
He matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, in January 1788,
aged seventeen, and in due course, in 1795, proceeded Master
of Arts. He came from Denbury, of which he was already
Incumbent, to his new parish of Dartington, in 1799.
Many children were born in Dartington Parsonage to him
and to Margaret Spedding his wife, of whom Richard Hurrell
Froude, named for his paternal grandfather Richard Hurrell of
Modbury, was the eldest. His birth was on March 25, 1803.
Certain critics who disliked the aroma, real or imaginary, of
the Oxford Movement, seemed to harbour, in after years, a
special grudge against Hurrell for his Marian circumstances.
It was, as it were, piling offence on offence that he entered
the world on the Feast of the Annunciation, and consciously,
votively belonged to the College of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary at Oxford. He
was privately baptized at home, and with his next brother,
carried up the hill to be received in the ancient Church at
the Hall gates (again <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary’s), on the 17th of April, 1805.
Hurrell seems to have been from the first a stormy sort of child,
<!--029.png--><!--Blank Page-->
<!--030.png-->
<!--031.png--><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><span class="pageno">5</span>
handsome, and odd, and adored by his relatives. Like the
young Persians in their national prime, he learned ‘to ride, and
to speak truth.’ He was sent early to the Free School at
Ottery <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary, where he lived in his master’s house. This was
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> George May Coleridge, nephew of that poet who has
made classic the lovely neighbourhood to all readers of English.
He survived until 1847, dear to all the Froudes. (Perhaps
it is not generally known that Mr. James Anthony Froude,
then in deacon’s orders, was responsible for Mr. Coleridge’s
funeral sermon at <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary Church, Torquay.) Hurrell was
as happy at his first School as a dreamy rebel boy always
subject to moods and to home-sickness could well be. Everything
was done, at any rate, to keep him happy. His own
memories of the green village, with its great minster and its
bright stream, seem to have been pleasant ones. A lady who
was but a young child during his last months at Dartington
recalls his frank smile at drawing in a lottery a picture of
Ottery Church, which she had coveted, lotteries not being
abhorred then, as now, by Christian folk. Had the winner
known of the little girl’s envy, he would certainly have parted
with his treasure on the spot; for he was a born de-collector.
Hurrell began, almost as soon as he could hold a pen, to draw
well, and to write agreeable letters. At thirteen he was sent to
Eton. A year or two before, that is, in or about 1814, he sat
for his portrait to that lovable interesting man and capable
artist, William Brockedon, Archdeacon Froude’s particular
protégé and most grateful friend.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_10" id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span> It may have been begun
as one of many thank-offerings; for some reason, it was left
unfinished. Brockedon was a patient person, by all accounts.
Perhaps wild little Master Froude, for all his innocent looks,
may have been, in the immortal words of Pet Marjorie, ‘whot
human nature cant indure.’ The Archdeacon, too, was critical,
and thought his friend happiest in sketch-work, and that to
finish, with him, was, sometimes, to over-refine. Who could
have foreseen that the abandoned canvas was long to take on
<!--032.png--><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pageno">6</span>
unique accidental value to persons then unborn who should be
interested in his sitter? For though that childish sitter was to
live over a score of years longer, and endear himself to men of
a certain school of thought for ever, there was no discoverable
hand but William Brockedon’s to tell them how he looked.
There was not known until the other day a single other portrait,
not so much as a silhouette, of a draughtsman associated with
so many, both at home and at College, who could draw.</p>

<span class="credit">From a water-colour drawing by Arthur Holdsworth Froude</span></p>
</div>

<p>The boy, with his half-indolent, half-clairvoyant way of
studying, and his high spirits in and out-of-doors, got on fairly
well at Eton,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_11" id="fnanchor_11"></a><a href="#footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span> though his years there seem to have made no
great impress on his mind and character. He developed,
perhaps, too slowly, and too much by instinct and intuition, to
be much harmed or helped by a Public School. Winthrop
Mackworth Praed was one of his memorable contemporaries
there; Edward Bouverie Pusey, though in an upper Form,
was another.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_12" id="fnanchor_12"></a><a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span> Like Pusey, Hurrell had a talisman and a
safeguard in the love of a pious mother. The extreme natural
sympathy between them was heightened by the boy’s fickle
health, and his unconscious appeal for continued care. One
experience of early invalidism and its results, lasting for some
time, drew from Margaret Froude an oblique comment or protest
which is enough to make one love and admire her womanliness.
She drew up a letter to an imaginary correspondent, which was
really intended for her tall son himself. It sounds wholly like
a page from the <cite>Spectator</cite>, in Steele’s tenderest whimsical vein;
and it would be an ungenerous lad (her Hurrell certainly knew
not how to be ungenerous) who would not be touched by the
genuine foreboding sorrow breathing through it. Whether it
was ever actually left in his way is doubtful; a passage in his
Journal may imply that he knew nothing of it until after her
death. Its date lies early in 1820.</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have a son who is giving me a good deal of
uneasiness at this time, from causes which I persuade myself
<!--033.png--><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><span class="pageno">7</span>
are not altogether common; and having used my best
judgment about him for seventeen years, I at last begin to
think it incompetent to the case, and apply to you for advice.
From his very birth his temper has been peculiar: pleasing,
intelligent, and attaching, when his mind was undisturbed, and
he was in the company of people who treated him reasonably
and kindly; but exceedingly impatient under vexatious
circumstances; very much disposed to find his own amusement
in teasing and vexing others; and almost entirely incorrigible
when it was necessary to reprove him. I never could find a
successful mode of treating him. Harshness made him
obstinate and gloomy; calm and long displeasure made him
stupid and sullen; and kind patience had not sufficient power
over his feelings to force him to govern himself. His disposition
to worry made his appearance the perpetual signal
for noise and disturbance among his brothers and sisters; and
this it was impossible to stop, though a taste for quiet, and
constant weak health, made it to me almost insupportable.
After a statement of such great faults, it may seem an inconsistency
to say that he nevertheless still bore about him strong
marks of a promising character. In all points of substantial
principle his feelings were just and high. He had (for his age)
an unusually deep feeling of admiration for everything which
was good and noble; his relish was lively, and his taste good,
for all the pleasures of the imagination; and he was also quite
conscious of his own faults, and, untempted, had a just dislike
to them. On these grounds I built my hope that his reason
would gradually correct his temper, and do that for him
which his friends could not accomplish. Such a hope was
necessary to my peace of mind; for I will not say that he
was dearer to me than my other children, but he was my first
child, and certainly he could not be dearer. This expectation
has been realised, gradually, though very slowly. The
education his father chose for him agreed with him; his mind
expanded and sweetened; and even some more material
faults (which had grown out of circumstances uniting with his
temper) entirely disappeared. His promising virtues became
my most delightful hopes, and his company my greatest
pleasure. At this time he had a dangerous illness, which he
<!--034.png--><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><span class="pageno">8</span>
bore most admirably. The consequences of it obliged him
to leave his School, submit for many months to the most
troublesome restraints, and to be debarred from all the
amusements and pleasures of his age, though he felt, at the
same time, quite competent to them. All this he bore not
only with patience and compliance, but with a cheerful
sweetness which endeared him to all around him. He
returned home for the confirmation of his health, and he
appeared to me all I could desire. His manners were tender
and kind, his conversation highly pleasing, and his occupations
manly and rational. The promising parts of his character,
like Aaron’s rod, appeared to have swallowed up all the rest,
and to have left us nothing but his health to wish for.&mdash;After
such an account, imagine the pain I must feel on being
forced to acknowledge that the ease and indulgence of home
is bringing on a relapse into his former habits. I view it with
sincere alarm as well as grief, as he must remain here many
many months, and a strong return to ill-conduct, at his age, I
do not think would ever be recovered. I will mention some
facts, to show that my fears are not too forward. He has a
near relation, who has attended him through his illness with
extraordinary tenderness, and who never made a difference
between night and day, if she could give him the smallest
comfort, to whom he is very troublesome, and not always
respectful. He told her, in an argument, the other day, that
“she lied, and knew she did,” without (I am ashamed to say)
the smallest apology. I am in a wretched state of health, and
quiet is important to my recovery, and quite essential to my
comfort; yet he disturbs it, for what he calls “funny tormenting,”
without the slightest feeling, twenty times a day. At one
time he kept one of his brothers screaming, from a sort of
teasing play, for near an hour under my window. At another,
he acted a wolf to his baby brother, whom he had promised
never to frighten again. All this worry has been kept up
upon a day when I have been particularly unwell. He also
knows at the same time very well, that if his head does but
ache, it is not only my occupation, but that of the whole
family, to put an end to everything which can annoy him.</p>

<p>‘You will readily see, dear Sir, that our situation is very
<!--035.png--><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pageno">9</span>
difficult and very distressing. He is too old for any correction
but that of his own reason; and how to influence that, I know
not! Your advice will greatly oblige</p>

<p class="p0 center">‘A very anxious parent,<br />
‘M. F.</p>

<p class="p0">‘<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I have complained to him seriously of this day,
and I thought he must have been hurt; but I am sorry to say
that he has whistled almost ever since.’</p>

<p class="p2">The kind relative, who was so ungraciously repaid for her
goodness, was his aunt Miss Mary Spedding, the eldest of all
her family, devoted to her only sister Margaret, and to that
sister’s memory; the baby brother, who must have conceived
of the wolf as a perseveringly disagreeable animal, was James
Anthony Froude, then nearly two years old. A year later, on
February 16, 1821, Margaret Froude breathed her lovely soul
away, and was laid to rest next the south porch of Dartington
Church, where her children’s feet passed in and out on Sunday
mornings over the flagstones, between the first spring flowers.
‘The Froudes were eight in family,’ wrote Isaac Williams, on
a happy visit long after. On the morrow of their bereavement,
this was the junior roll-call in Robert Froude’s desolate
Parsonage:</p>

<p class="p0 indent5">
Richard Hurrell, aged not quite eighteen.<br />
Robert Hurrell, aged sixteen years, ten months.<br />
John Spedding, just fourteen.<br />
Margaret, aged twelve years, nine months.<br />
Phillis Jane, nearly eleven and a half.<br />
William, aged ten years, three months.<br />
Mary Isabella, not quite seven and a half.<br />
James Anthony, under three.</p>

<p>Hurrell Froude was admitted Commoner by the University
of Oxford and matriculated at Oriel College, within a few
weeks of his mother’s death, on April 13, 1821. His delicate
health had kept him back: his father and his brothers all
matriculated at seventeen. Robert Froude, ‘Bob,’ was then
entering upon his Sixth Form at Eton. Little Margaret began
at once, under guidance, her tender and long continued task
of comforting her father and mothering the motherless. She
<!--036.png--><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pageno">10</span>
found no time to seek her own happiness, till her marriage in
1844,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_13" id="fnanchor_13"></a><a href="#footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span> when only her father and herself, William and Anthony,
survived. John Spedding Froude died in 1841, thirty-four
years old, and, like his two elder brothers, unmarried. Of Phillis,
William, Mary, and (James) Anthony, Hurrell’s own annals
will have more to say. Beside one of the leafy winding
roads of Dartington rose afterwards a little grey almshouse,
and over the doorway a stone tablet with this inscription:</p>

<p class="center">
‘<span class="smcap">Impensis Mariae Spedding<br />
pia recordatione sororis suae<br />
Margaretae Froude<br />
haec domus<br />
in perpetuam eleemosynam<br />
extructa est.<br />
Agellum circumjacentem in<br />
eosdem usus erogavit<br />
Henricus Champernowne.</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="muchsmaller">A.D. MDCCCXXXV.</span>’</p>

<p class="unindent">It must have been building during the last year of Hurrell’s
life, and no doubt with his ‘very managing sort of mind’ he
worked into it some of his rather primitive Gothic theories.
There still is the home which Mary Spedding’s love built,
where age and poverty have privacy and peace, and roses at
every window, and thankful sweet remembrance of human
kindness, as in the ancient time.</p>

<p>Away from home, and without his mother, Hurrell fell
silent enough; and his sadness would have hurt and corroded
him, had it not been for the exquisite friendship which sprang
up between him and his tutor at Oriel. That tutor was
John Keble. It is pleasant to think of these two, with their
spiritual foreheads and strong chins, in that fashionable Georgian
College full of decanters and gold tufts, and ‘rows in quad.’
No one in all England whom Hurrell Froude in his youth
was likely to know could have so fostered in him, even by
his unconscious presence, whatsoever things are lovely and of
good report. According to Mr. J. A. Froude’s <cite>Short Studies</cite>
account, there was no very high level of supernatural religion
at Dartington Parsonage. ‘My father,’ he says, ‘was a High
<!--037.png--><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pageno">11</span>
Churchman of the old school. The Church itself he regarded
as part of the Constitution, and the Prayer-Book as an Act of
Parliament which only folly or disloyalty could quarrel with.’
This theory perfectly harmonised with the wonted order and
general practice fixed for a century before. The Royal
Arms, flanked by the lamentable monuments of all the local
gentry, dominated the chancel; the Squire’s pew had its fat
cushions, and a stove in the middle, and was walled away
from any view of the ignored Communion-table chastely covered
with green baize; plebeian hats were piled in the Font, and
there was a ‘national custom of bending forward in Church,’
as an almost too fond concession to Christian etiquette.
Truthful observers have given us the whole catalogue in print;
and it has been corroborated on every side within living
memory. The finer spirits who did not turn infidel must have
felt all this ugliness to be dreary and hideous enough, though
perhaps necessary to feed the sacred spite against the Middle
Ages, so Popishly ‘dark’ with candles and incense-coals,
pageants and bright Alleluias, brought into the service of
God. But to no one in the Church of England before the
Oxford Movement, did it seem an abnormal state of things.
Nor was it so, dogma being dead. When poor Hurrell’s
decided opinions had formed, he must have felt himself in
some domestic difficulty. Ritual was nothing to him except
as the language of belief: scant where that is feeble, full where
that is steadfast and profound; how it can be anything else
to man is not quite apparent to an inquiring mind. As he
never lived to work out his beliefs very far, he had no drastic
changes to suggest in the local ordinances, but he must have
dedicated some uphill work to the excellent parent whom
he truly reverenced, and ended by making over into a valuable
defender of sacramentalism. The numerous clerical progeny
of Squire Western, worthies like the famous fox-hunting
‘Păsson Freüde’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_14" id="fnanchor_14"></a><a href="#footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span> of his own blood, in another part of Devon,
remained faithful to the Constitution and Parliament, to pay
up for the Archdeacon’s partial defection.</p>

<p>Hurrell’s attitude towards the mother for whom his heart
ached, and towards those who won his fealty at home, discovered
<!--038.png--><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pageno">12</span>
itself day by day in letters to Mr. Keble, a record of
occasional thoughts, and the private journals which he kept
for his own conscience to whet itself upon. Sacred as these
pages are, they have been printed before in the opening volume
of his <cite>Remains</cite>; and they prove how very far he was from
being a mere intellectual theoriser, oblivious of daily duty and
common ties. His strife for perfection, a difficult and joyless
one at best, began with these. Some excerpts, scattered or
consecutive, will serve to show his sincerity and thoroughness:
how his thoughts ran; how he fed upon his mother’s memory;
with what lowliness he prayed for the divine help, and with
what merciless constancy he learned to discipline himself,
arraign his own motives, and master the bitter and sovereign
science of self-knowledge.</p>

<p>&mdash;‘Yesterday I was very indolent, but … my energies
were rather restored by reading some of my mother’s journal
at Vineyard. I did not recollect that I had been so unfeeling
to her during her last year. I thank God some of her writings
have been kept: that may be my salvation; but I have spent
the evening just as idly as if I had not seen it. I don’t know
how it is, but it seems to me that the consciousness of having
capacities for happiness, with no objects to gratify them, seems
to grow upon me, and puts me in a dreary way. Lord, have
mercy upon me.’</p>

<p>&mdash;‘Spent the morning tolerably well; read my mother’s
journal and prayers, two hours: I admire her more and more.
I pray God the prayers she made for me may be effectual, and
that her labours may not be in vain, but that God in His mercy
may have chosen this way of accomplishing them; and that my
reading them so long after they were made, and without any
intention of hers, may be the means by which the Holy Spirit
will awaken my spirit to those good feelings which she asked
for in my behalf. I hope, by degrees, I may get to consider
her relics in the light of a friend, derive from them advice and
consolation, and rest my troubled spirit under their shadow.
She seems to have had the same annoyances as myself, without
the same advantages, and to have written her thoughts down,
instead of conversation. As yet they have only excited my
feelings, and not produced any practical result.’</p>

<p><!--039.png--><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pageno">13</span>
&mdash;‘Read my mother’s journal till half-past twelve: here
and there I think I remember allusions. Everything I see in
it sends me back to her in my childhood: it gets such hold
of me that I can hardly think of anything else. It is a bad
way to give a general account of oneself at the end of a day:
people at that time are not competent judges of their actions;
besides, everyone ought to be dissatisfied with himself always:
it is better to give a detailed account like my mother’s by means
of which I may hereafter have some idea of what was my
standard of virtue, rather than my opinion of myself.’</p>

<p>&mdash;‘O Lord, consider it not as a mockery in me, that day
after day I present myself before Thee, professing penitence for
sins which I still continue to commit, and asking Thy grace
to assist me in subduing them, while my negligence renders it
ineffectual. O Lord, if I must judge of the future from the
past, and if the prayers which I am now about to offer up to
Thee will prove equally ineffectual with those which have
preceded them, then indeed it is a fearful thing to come before
Thee with professions whose fruitlessness seems a proof of
their insincerity! But Thine eye trieth my inward parts, and
knoweth my thoughts, independently of the actions which
proceed from them. “O that my ways were made so direct
that I might keep Thy statutes! I will walk in Thy commandments
when Thou hast set my heart at liberty.”’</p>

<p>&mdash;‘Read my mother’s journal. I hope it is beginning to
do me some serious good, without exciting such wild feelings
as it did at first.’</p>

<p>&mdash;‘I must fight against myself with all my might,
and watch my mind at every turning. It will be a good
thing for me to keep an exact account of my receipts and
spendings: it will be a check on silly prodigality. I mean to
save what I can by denying myself indulgences, in order to
have wherewith I may honour God and relieve the poor.’</p>

<p>&mdash;‘Perhaps you may think it very odd, but this summer<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_15" id="fnanchor_15"></a><a href="#footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span>
has been the first time I have had resolution to ask for the
papers which they found of my mother’s after her death. The
<!--040.png--><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pageno">14</span>
most interesting to me are some prayers, and two fragments
of [a] journal, one for the year 1809, I think, and the other in
1815. The prayers seem to have been a good deal later.’</p>

<p class="p2 center">(Not sent either.)</p>

<p>&mdash;‘All this summer I have been trying a sort of experiment
with myself, which, as I have had no one to talk to about it, has
brought on great fits of enthusiasm and despondency, and being
conscious at the time of most contemptible inconsistencies, both
in my high and dejected feelings, I set to work to keep a
journal of them, to answer the purpose of a sort of conversation
between my present and my future self: an idea which I got
from reading an old journal of my mother’s, which they found
after her death, and which I never could make up my mind to
look at till this summer.’</p>

<p class="p2">&mdash;‘I have confessed to myself a fresh thing to be on my
guard against. Every now and then I keep feeling anxious that
by bringing myself into strict command, I may acquire a
commanding air and manner, and am in a hurry to get rid of
the punishment of my former weakness. I sometimes try to
assume a dignified face as I meet men, and am never content
to be treated as a shilly-shally fellow. I must not care the
least, or ever indulge a thought, about the impression I make
on others;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_16" id="fnanchor_16"></a><a href="#footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span> but make myself <em>be</em> what I would, and let the
<em>seeming</em> take its course; or, rather, be glad of slights, as from
the Lord. This will be a hard struggle. O Lord, give me
strength to go through with it!’</p>

<p>&mdash;‘I felt as if I have got rid of a great weight from my
mind, in having given up the notion of regulating my particular
actions, by the sensible tendency I could perceive in them to
bring me towards my <ins title="to kalon">τὸ καλόν</ins>. I had always a mistrust in
this motive; and it seems quite a happiness to yield the
direction of myself to a Higher Power Who has said: “Seek
ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all
these things shall be added unto you.”’</p>

<p><!--041.png--><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pageno">15</span>
&mdash;‘It seems to me a great help towards making myself
indifferent to present things, to conjure up past events, and
distant places and people before me: things that happened at
Eton, or Ottery, or in the very early times of childhood. I felt
again to-day as if … the secret world of new pleasures and
wishes to which I am trying to gain admittance, is a mere
fancy. I must be careful to check high<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_17" id="fnanchor_17"></a><a href="#footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span> feelings, [as] they are
certain to become offences in a day or two, and must regulate
my practice by faith, and a steady imitation of great examples:
in hopes that, by degrees, what I now have only faint and
occasional glimpses of may be the settled objects on which
my imagination reposes, and that I may be literally hid in the
presence of the Lord.’</p>

<p>&mdash;‘I might not indeed be too penitent, but penitent in a
wrong way. Abstinences and self-mortifications may themselves
be a sort of intemperance: a food to my craving after some
sign that I am altering. They ought not to be persevered in,
farther than as they are instrumental to a change of character
in things of real importance: … how hard it is to keep a
pure motive for anything!… I will refrain, rather, by forcing
myself to talk, and attend to the wants of others [at table]
than by constantly thinking of myself.’</p>

<p>&mdash;‘Made good resolutions about behaviour when I go
home. Never to argue with my father, or remonstrate with
him, or offer my advice, unless in cases where I feel I should do
so to the [Provost?]. For even if it subjects me to unnecessary
inconvenience, it would do so equally in both cases; and, if I
would submit to it in one case through pusillanimity, I ought
in the other for a punishment. It would be a good way to
make opposite vices punish each other so, and be likely to
cure both in time. In the same way to behave to Bob and my
sisters as I would to [College equals?]: to comply with their
wishes, and not interfere with their opinions, except where I
would with the latter. I must try at home to be as humble,
and submissive, and complying, as I can; and here as resolute
and vigorous, till I get to be the same in all places and all
company. I do not preclude myself from making amendments
in this resolution, till I have left Oxford.’</p>

<p><!--042.png--><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pageno">16</span>
&mdash;‘It has turned out a beautiful day, and fasting will cost
but little pain. I have just been shocked at hearing that &mdash;&mdash;’s
acquaintance, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, had shot himself yesterday. How
strongly it reminds me that I understand little of the things
invisible which I talk and think about, when the most terrible
occurrences having taken place quite close to me affect me so
little! I could work up my feelings easy enough, but it is
enthusiasm<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_18" id="fnanchor_18"></a><a href="#footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span> to anticipate in this way the steady effects of moral
discipline; even supposing both effects are, whilst they last,
the same. I could not help crying violently just now, on
reading over my mother’s paper. The ideas somehow mixed
up together, and forced on my thoughts what a condition I
may be in as to things unseen, and yet be unconscious of it.
O God, keep up in my mind a feeling of true humility, suitable
to my blindness and the things that I am among.’</p>

<p>&mdash;‘I have just been reading over my account of the
time I spent at home last summer…. The great root
of all my complicated misdeeds seems to have been (1) A
want of proper notions respecting my relations to my father.
(2) A notion that I was a competent judge how to make other
people happy, by giving a tone to their pursuits. (3) A craving
after the pleasures which I admire. (4) Arrogant pretensions to
superiority. (5) A wish to make my conduct seem consistent
to myself and others. The first is the main point, and when I
have carried that, the rest will all go easily. The only way
we can ever be comfortable is by our all uniting to make his will
our law, and what little I can do towards this will be better
accomplished by example than by presumptuous advice….
Nor do I see how I can so well repress my arrogance as by
always keeping in mind that I am in the presence of one who
is to me the type of the Most High.’</p>

<p class="p2 center">(To <span class="smcap">Keble</span>.)</p>

<p>&mdash;‘Among the other lights which have been gradually dawning
on me, one from following the guidance of which I hope I
may derive great comfort, has made me conscious of the debt of
reverence that I owe my father: not only in that, bearing his
sacred name, he is proposed to me as a type of the Almighty
<!--043.png--><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pageno">17</span>
upon earth, but that he has, in his high character, so demeaned
himself as to become a fortress and rock of defence to all those
who are blessed with his protection. Under his shadow I
will, by God’s blessing, rest in peace, and will endeavour for the
future to esteem his approbation as the highest earthly honour
and his love as the highest reward. I feel in this resolution
real peace; and while I am conscious of endeavouring to act up
to it, will try, as you advise me, to quiet my gloomy apprehensions.’</p>

<p>&mdash;‘O my God! I dare no longer offer to Thee my
diseased petitions in the words by which wise and holy men
have shaped their intercourse between earth and Heaven.
Suffer me, with whose vileness they can have had no fellowship,
to frame for myself my isolated supplication. O my Father,
by Thy power I began to be, and by Thy protection Thou
hast continued to me my misused existence: yet I have forsaken
Thee, my only Strength, and forgotten Thee, my only
Wisdom. I have neglected to obey Thy voice, and gone a-whoring
after my own inventions. As soon as I was born, I
went astray and spake lies. I loved the delights which Thou
hast given me more than Thee who gavest them; and I
dreaded the might which Thou hast delegated to man more
than Thee the Almighty…. Yet, praised be Thy holy Name,
Thou hast not even thus utterly left me destitute; but with
hideous dreams Thou hast affrighted me; and with perpetual
mortifications Thou hast disquieted me; and with the recollections
of bright things fascinated me; and with a holy friend
Thou hast visited me. Thou hast sought Thy servant while
astray in the wilderness; Thou hast shown me the horrible
pit, the mire and clay in which I am wallowing: O mayest
Thou, of Thy great goodness, set my feet upon a rock, and
order my goings. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be
clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. Turn
Thy face from my sins, and put out all my misdeeds. Make
me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
O give me the comfort of Thy help again, and stablish me
with Thy free Spirit…. Bless, O Lord, with Thy constant
favour and protection that high spirit whom, as Thy type upon
this earth, Thou hast interposed between me and the evils I
<!--044.png--><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pageno">18</span>
have merited. Fill him, O Lord, with the fulness of Thy
grace, that, running with patience the race which has been
set before him, he may finish his course at Thy good time
with joyfulness, and find a rest from his labours in the portion
of the righteous.’</p>

<p>&mdash;‘I will be cautious about talking of myself and my feelings:
what I like; whom I admire; what are my notions of a
high character; how few people I find to sympathise with me
on any subject; and many other egotistical, mawkish, useless
matters, about which I have suffered myself to prate. Also,
I will avoid obtruding my advice, and taking high grounds
to which I have no pretensions.’</p>

<p>&mdash;‘Just now, at breakfast,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_19" id="fnanchor_19"></a><a href="#footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span> I felt the inconvenience of
not omitting an oath in a story I told of Sheridan. I felt
directly that I lost ground, and should be unable to make a
stand, if conversation were to take a turn I disliked. I must
be watchful and strict with myself in this respect: for, if I
comply with my father’s wishes, and enter freely into society,
I shall have much harder work to fight off my old shuffling
vanity, and shall be drawn, from not feeling my own ground,
into foolishness and flash, and everything that is disgusting.’</p>

<p>&mdash;‘I used to speculate on the delight of keeping fasts
upon the river in fine weather, among beautiful scenery,
rather than in my dull rooms at Oxford; but last Friday was
a real fine day, yet I did not at all turn it to this account.
Though I ate little, it was something very different from my
Oxford fasts, and still more so from what I then used to
picture to myself, when I should get home. I waste time in
preparing boats, and thoughts in speculating on schemes for
expeditions, and for improving our appointments. Also, I
observe other bad effects resulting from my misconduct, which
I cannot but regard as signs that good spirits are deserting
me. The other evening I had an argument with my father,
almost in a sort of tone which I used to feel ashamed of last
summer, and which, in the Christmas vacation, I think I was
not even tempted to; and when I caught myself getting
untuned, it cost me a [severe<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_20" id="fnanchor_20"></a><a href="#footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></span>] effort to check myself; nor was
it till the next morning that all the effects of it subsided, and I
<!--045.png--><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pageno">19</span>
felt quite good-natured and humble again. In this fight I was
greatly helped by the experience of former conflicts, and
recollecting the ways I had caught myself in self-deceit, so that
it gives me some hope as well as humiliation. I pray God that
He will not suffer all my feeble efforts to be wasted, and prove
quite ineffectual, and that He will enable me to lie down to-night
with a better conscience.’</p>

<p>&mdash;‘Just now, in riding home from Denbury,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_21" id="fnanchor_21"></a><a href="#footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span> I got arguing
with my father about the little chance anyone has of doing good,
in a way rather inconsistent with our relative condition; yet,
when I thought I was going rather too far, could hardly convince
myself that, at any particular moment, it was incumbent
on me to stop. It is this self-deceiving disposition that I am
afraid of.’</p>

<p>&mdash;‘I will brace myself and keep my attention on the alert
on this S[alcombe?] expedition, by a vow about my food: I
will make my meals as simple as I can, without being observed
upon; will take no command upon myself, but obey my
father’s instructions to the utmost of my power; will try to
make no objections or propositions unless called upon; and
that no one may be able to put me out of the way [of self-denial]
everyone shall have theirs, however disagreeable they
may seem to me.’</p>

<p>&mdash;‘We returned to-day, and on reading over these resolutions,
which I called a vow, I find I have acted very poorly up
to them. I believe they have operated as a sort of check upon
me in some respects, that I have been less of an epicure and
less of an interferer than I should have been else. But yet,
quite at starting, I suggested, when my father proposed going
ashore, that it would take a longer time than he calculated
on: but this was merely a suggestion. And on one of the
evenings when we were by ourselves, I argued about people
going to Church in a way very inconsistent with our relative
situations; neither was I quite cordial in my acquiescence
with propositions of my father’s about minor excursions at
S[alcombe?] and feel as if I had pressed unpleasantly on him
some of my opinions about tides, and names of places.’</p>

<p><!--046.png--><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pageno">20</span>
&mdash;‘Yesterday, I was talking to [Phill?] about [Peg?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_22" id="fnanchor_22"></a><a href="#footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></span>];
and among other things, when I said how considerate
she was about everybody’s wants, and how she was always
on the lookout for an opportunity to relieve them, I said
(and have reason enough to say it) that things of that
sort did not come into my head. But I am afraid I must
confess that I was a little annoyed at [Phill? allowing] that
she did not think they did! I cannot accuse myself of having
been so insincere as to have laid a trap for a compliment; but
I was not quite prepared to find that my negligence was such
as to obtrude itself on the observation of those who would
always make the best of one. O God! give me grace to
look on this as a warning voice from Thee, and let the remembrance
of it brace my energies for the future…. Also, I yesterday
gave way to a covetous inconsistent wish for a beautiful
colt that we happened to see, and which my father had half
a mind I should get for my own. I feel all these selfish
wishes crowding on me, and have no clear decided rule by
which to check them. I think I will always ask myself, when
I wish for an elegant superfluity, what business I have to be
so much better off than my sisters, and will not allow myself
anything I can avoid till I have got them all the things they
are reasonably in want of.’</p>

<p>&mdash;‘Teach me to be ever mindful of the wants and wishes
of others, and that I may never omit an opportunity of adding
to their happiness; let each particular of their condition
be present with me, what they are doing or suffering. I
am most fearfully deficient in this mark of a child of God.
Protect me from all covetous desires of the pleasant things
which money can procure: the D[enbury?] cottage, the new
dining-room window, nice furniture, equipage, musical instruments,
or any other thing, in order to obtain which I must
lessen my means of benefiting others.</p>

<p>&mdash;‘I have done many things to-day that I ought to
be ashamed of. For instance: I said to the [Provost?] I
had not examined carefully an analysis that I had hardly read
a word of. I have assumed, too, a harsh manner in examining.
I feel too anxious to show my own knowledge of the
<!--047.png--><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pageno">21</span>
subjects on which I am examining. Was very inattentive at
morning Chapel, and not sorry to find that there was none in
the evening. I believe the day before yesterday I made a
bungle in examining W[illy] in Euclid, which made him
appear to be doing wrong while he was quite right, but did
not discover it in time to rectify it by confession (which I
hope I should have done).’</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="p2">The youth who wrote much else thus singularly and
severely of himself, had an almost fierce sincerity. At an
early hour, he made up his mind to be in his strength,
what many men are said to be in their weakness, ‘nobody’s
enemy but his own,’ and he carried out both clauses implied
in the contract. Neither at Eton nor at Oxford, with
opportunities by the score, did he ever make a single
‘influential’ personal friend; to no position or emolument did
he ever aspire, though he was to give unremitting and precious
labour to what he believed to be the best cause in the world.
‘Froude and I were nobodies,’ said Newman, two lifetimes
later, with a touch of whimsical pride. Like a child of
Socrates, our philosopher would fain see how many things
there are which he could do without; like a child of Seneca,
he would fain enjoy this life, with the zest possible to those
alone who are always ready to leave it. Enough of this
Journal, most practical in all its self-searching. It appears
to concern itself with trivialities only to those who do
not realise how relentless is the ascetic spirit, and how
small a quarry it will still hunt when all the tigers are met
and exterminated. As was said of a greater than Hurrell
Froude: ‘<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce diable d’homme a toujours été en se perfectionnant.
Il serait devenu honnête homme, si on l’eut laissé vivre.</cite>’</p>

<p>When Mr. Keble went down to his curacy at Southrop,
at the beginning of the Long Vacation of 1823,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_23" id="fnanchor_23"></a><a href="#footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span> Hurrell went
with him to read for his B.A. degree, which he took in
December of that year. The summer was to him, as to one
<!--048.png--><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pageno">22</span>
of his companions there, Isaac Williams, the turning-point in
his career. In those tranquil fields and winding roads and
the solemn little village Church, where he found ‘a man
wholly made up of love, and religion a reality,’ Hurrell began
to see the Last Things: he never could forget the place, the
person, and the occasion which meant so much to him in the
Providence of God. His third companion, Robert Wilberforce,
‘did not feel towards Keble,’ wrote Isaac Williams, ‘as we
did at that time, having been brought up in an opposite
school.’ In all the fresh and brave happinesses of nature and
of grace which were round Keble like an aureole wherever he
went, Hurrell brightened and strengthened visibly.</p>

<p class="center small">‘You are my Spring: and when you smile, I grow.’</p>

<p>He learned from him to follow conscience and to fear applause.
As soon as he parted from Mr. Keble, their long correspondence
began, and the home-loving pupil was proud indeed when the
‘first man in Oxford,’ as Newman enthusiastically called him,
came on a visit to Dartington. We know from recent testimony
of a delightful pen<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_24" id="fnanchor_24"></a><a href="#footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></span> how dear the neighbourhood became to
Mr. Keble, and how often he would wander away from the
animated household of his friends to the fourteenth-century
priest’s-house hard by at Little Hempston, an almost unique
survival, with its small quadrangle, its hall and solar, of
Chaucer’s time. The lovely old Vicarage, in its still secluded
situation, had taken captive Hurrell’s twenty-year old fancy,
as a letter of 1823 to Mr. Keble shows.</p>

<p>‘I will pledge my own peculiar veracity to the following
statement: The situation is, I am confident (and on this
matter experience has peculiarly qualified me to judge), [by]
far the most beautiful place in the world, the focus of
irradiated perfection, the favoured haunt of romance and
sentiment, the very place which, if you recollect the circumstance,
you taxed me with a disposition to romanticity for
encomiasing, when I informed you that I had destined it
for my <ins title="krêsphygeton">κρησφύγετον</ins>, where, unmolested, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">flumina amem silvasque
inglorius</i>. The Parsonage is situated in a steep and narrowish
glen, which intersects a long line of coppice that overhangs
<!--049.png--><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pageno">23</span>
the Dart for the length of nearly a mile, and rises almost
perpendicularly out of the river to the height of about two
hundred feet. The stream there is still, clear, and very deep;
on the opposite side is Dartington; and a line of narrow, long,
flat meadows, interspersed with large oak and ash trees, forms
the bank of the river. The steep woods on the Little
Hempston side are in the form of a concave crescent (thereby
agreeing with Buckland).<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_25" id="fnanchor_25"></a><a href="#footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></span> From the Parsonage to the river
is a steep descent through a small orchard; at the bottom of
which, on turning the corner which the glen aforesaid makes
on its north side with the course of the stream, you come at
once on a sort of excavation, of about half an acre, which,
terminated by an overhanging rock, forms a break in the line
of coppice aforesaid. In this said rock young M. found the
hawks’ nests. I think they build there every year. On the
opposite side, <i>i.e.</i> the Dartington side, is what was formerly
a little island, but now no longer claims that proud title, in
the oaks of which I am in hopes we shall soon have an heronry,
as they haunt there all the summer. After this I should not
so utterly despair of success, if I felt less interested in the
event;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_26" id="fnanchor_26"></a><a href="#footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span> but as it is, I can hardly hope for so great a
gratification.’</p>

<p>Several months later, he is still in the descriptive vein.</p>

<p>‘When I came home I found things looking most dismal.
My father had cut all the laurels to the roots, in hopes of
making them come up thicker. A field almost outside the
windows, which had been put in tillage, was ploughed so
extremely ill that we were afraid it would be forced to be tilled
with turnips (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dî talem campis avertite pestem!</em>) instead of
clover…. The copse also, which overhung the river by the
Little Hempston rocks, was in great part gone, “and the place
thereof knew it no more.” I hope the rest may be spared.’</p>

<p>The laurels he had planted gave the energetic Archdeacon
some trouble. In his old age he had them all swept away, and
made a needed if unromantic improvement in the outlook of
the beautiful old house. Hurrell’s implicit differences with his
<!--050.png--><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pageno">24</span>
‘knowing, quick, and handy’ father, so many of whose best
qualities he shared, hinged laughably often on such things as
the culture of trees and the make and management of boats.
In all, he did his best to become what the epitaphs of the time
call ‘an humble obsequious son.’</p>

<p>Hurrell took only a second class in Classics and Mathematics
(disappointing and astonishing everyone who knew him)
during 1824. But he had exactly the sort of mind which,
sooner or later, would come to grief with any curriculum.</p>

to our having a four-oar given us, as infallibly tending to
debilitate and torpify the mental faculties! I am afraid it is
not in my stars to be ever contented; for I confess I do
not feel that serene felicity which I pictured to myself last
October as my destiny; though my delight is not impaired

<p>‘<ins title="Ainotate">Αἰνότατε</ins>: I have been long intending to thank you for
your benevolent instructions, which (I don’t know whether I
ought to be ashamed or not in confessing it) answered a
purpose different from what they were intended for; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, they
convinced me and (what was more to the point) my father,
that I knew so little about the matter, and had so little time
left, that it was no use to proceed. It certainly was no small
satisfaction to me to have so good an excuse for giving up
what I had exhausted the entertainment of, and had nothing
but the laborious to come. Also, the weather has been so
very beautiful this spring, and the delicious blue sky, with
hardly a cloud on it for six weeks, so very tempting, that it
was hardly possible to help being idle. But somehow my
conscience rather misgives me, and what with admonitions now
and then from my father, and my lately having taken up with
reading sermons, I am become “as melancholy as Moorditch
or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe”; so that upon the
whole I think I must come to you to be prosed and put into a
better way…. By the by, I am now officiating as ethical
instructor to B[ob?], in which capacity I have been much
humiliated at finding how little I know about the matter; but
it makes me get them<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_28" id="fnanchor_28"></a><a href="#footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span> up, which perhaps I should never have
done else. I do not think them at all less prosy and long-winded
than I used, and I would bet Bishop Butler against all
the ‘stotles in the world. Among other things I am also
becoming something of a florist, and something of an architect,
in which latter I make some proficiency. I am a powerful
coadjutor (though I say it that should not say it), in the
completion of D[enbury], which bears a different aspect from
when you saw it last. It will be a pretty monastic-looking
erection, and if we could but make it old, and buy a ghost or
<!--052.png--><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pageno">26</span>
two, would be somewhat sentimental. For, thanks to my
grandmother’s<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_29" id="fnanchor_29"></a><a href="#footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span> perverseness, she would not have a new house
except in the shape of an old one repaired, which superinduced
the necessity of so many crooked little passages and such an
irregular exterior, that my father had an excuse for doing what
would else have seemed fanciful. Talking about architecture,
a new town<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_30" id="fnanchor_30"></a><a href="#footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></span> is going to be built down by Torbay, which is to
cut out Brighton and every place. The ground where it is to
stand is perfectly unencumbered with houses, and covered with
trees, so that there is every advantage at starting; and all will
be done on a general plan, so that the buildings shall as little
as possible interfere with each other. If you know anyone
that wishes for a delightful sea-residence, send him there. You
must know you narrowly escaped having a poetical effusion
from me the other day. I was out in so magnificent an
evening; but being, as you know, a man of few words, I found
that by the time I had made my verses scan and construe,
they would be so remote from an effusion, at least in the
quality of being <em>effunded</em>, that it was better to be contented
with a prosaic statement: <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, that coming home from Little
Hempston the other evening after sunset, and having with
some difficulty discovered and scrambled into my boat, which
was moored under an old stump at the bottom of the woods,
as I proceeded on my course down the river, the sky gradually
assumed a portentous appearance, and distant flashes of
lightning, growing gradually more distinct, began at regular
intervals. Things however are not so constituted as to allow
the sublime to amalgamate with the comfortable: according to
the decrees of Fate, the storm which had lingered in the upper
regions till I had got so far on my way home as to be out of
reach of shelter from Dartington House, now came down with
such violence as to save me the trouble of running at any rate,
by convincing me that whether I was out five minutes or fifteen
I should be in an equally bad case. The thunder got very
loud, and the lightning was so green and brilliant, that I could
see the stiles and gates, and even their latches, like the spectres
of the things from which “<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">nox abstulit atra colorem</cite>.” Sometimes
the flashes lasted for nearly a second, and dazzled me so
<!--053.png--><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="pageno">27</span>
that after they were passed I could make no use of the twilight
at all. Having got thus far, I feel in the awkward situation of
having told a story without a point, and feel inclined to resort
to the usual remedy, and apply to my invention to help me
out of the scrape with a marvellous conclusion. Perhaps
however you may be contented with a moral: so here goes.
As good never comes unalloyed with evil, so that very evil
often serves to give it a relish which it might otherwise be
destitute of. I could not have reckoned this as an adventure,
if I had not been forced to change my clothes when I came
home.’</p>

<p>‘… Now I proceed to vindicate my character from the unwarrantable

the Æschylus and Herodotus with which I shall in course of

short space I shall be at least equal to Peter Elmsley,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_31" id="fnanchor_31"></a><a href="#footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></span> and I
would advise you to prepare the examining masters for the
reception of such a luminary…. My father, I must assure you,
has received no favourable impression of your moral organisation
from the injudicious exposure which you made in your
last letter. But I will urge the matter no further; … the
shortness of the time during which your <ins title="energeiai">ἐνέργεαι</ins> have been

<p>‘… <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Suaviter ut nunc est inquam</i>: but it was not so with
poor [Williams] in the packet, being that he was sick all the way
from Portland Head to Plymouth Sound; and was so completely
miserable that he would not be spoken to, and kept on groaning
out that he would give all he ever expected in the world
to be on shore. By this unfortunate circumstance he was
prevented from seeing the sun rise over the watery element in
the very act of “pillowing his chin upon an orient wave,” and
from bearing testimony (which I can do) that there is nothing
the least sublime in the mere fact of being out of sight of land,
and having nothing but the sky and the sea, and the sea and
the sky. But what was most melancholy of all, he was unable
to get a glimpse of all the glorious coast of the south
promontory of Devonshire…. Next day we came upon
Southampton, while it was under one of the most imposing
magnificent effects possible: a rainbow, lost in a dark cloud
which was raining as hard as it could pelt, was resting one of
its ends on the woods: and the sun on the waters, and the
spires, made the misty smoke that was rising up from the town,
quite imposing and sentimental. However, my complacency
was much alloyed by the tantalising sight of the beautiful
yachts, with their glittering sails, skimming along in the breeze,
which had just started up after the violent rain which had
fallen, and the melancholy <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Heu, non mea</i> rushed on me with

<p>‘About the poems&mdash;it is really too ludicrous for a fellow
like me to sit down deliberately to criticise the taste and
philosophy of a production of yours: so that I have no
inclination to expose or commit myself, by detailing to you
my remarks on particular passages. There are, as you may
suppose, many places which, in fun, I would show fight about;
and there is something which I should call Sternhold-and-Hopkinsy
in the diction, of which I began to note down the
first instances I met; but, finding it go through, I concluded
it was done on a theory. But though I am not quite such a
fool as to think my opinion worth offering in point of criticism,
it may not, perhaps, be quite useless to confess it as a matter
of fact, with which you may begin an induction as to the
probable good you may do by publication. I confess, then,
and not without some shame, that you seem to me to have
addressed yourself too exclusively to plain matter-of-fact good
sort of people … and not to have taken much pains to
interest and guide the feelings of people who feel acutely, nor
to have given much attention to that dreary visionary existence
which they make themselves very uncomfortable by indulging
in, and which I should have hoped it was the peculiar province
of religious poetry to sober down into practical piety. I know
all this may be great nonsense, may be even humbug; for long
experience has convinced me how much I can cheat myself as
to my real feelings. But that you may see that it has not
been concocted since, but was the impression made on me
while reading, I will extract a note which I made … I
suppose I meant that things like Gray’s <cite>Elegy</cite>, which turn
melancholy to its proper account, by pointing out the vanity
of the world without telling us so, seem to me more to answer
the purpose. And now I will cease making an ass of myself!…
I am half-conscious that the same sort of objections might
be made against the Psalms; and though I cannot but think
that they will make your poems less generally liked and
read, I am far from confident that it may not be better,

upon the whole, for those who attend to them as a religious
duty.</p>

<p>‘I can hardly shut up without telling you of such an
interesting set of fellows that we heard of in our peregrinations.
They were sixteen French fishermen and three boys, who had
all come over, in one boat, to get bait on the English coast,
and were kept there ten days by the wind: all that time they
sat upon the deck knitting stockings and nightcaps; and, when
Sunday came, they were just so far out at sea that the people
on the coast could hear them singing the Roman Catholic
service so beautifully, and in the evening they came on shore,
and danced, out of mere jollity, for an hour. They were such
grateful fellows, that a gentleman on the coast who had done
them some kindness, could hardly get rid of them without his
giving them some commission to do for him in France, <i>i.e.</i> to
let them smuggle something over for him; and, when they
could not remove his scruples as a Justice of [the] Peace, they
caught him an immense fish, and were quite disappointed that
he would not accept it as a present.’</p>

<p class="p2">The great mass of Keble’s letters to his pupil and friend
have disappeared: but we have the answer promptly sent to this,
and written with his own winning humility. ‘For your telling
me exactly what you think about [the verses] I shall hold you
in greater honour as long as I live.’ He goes on, sweetly and
sagaciously, to explain that <cite>The Christian Year</cite> but aimed at
helping ‘the plain and good.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_32" id="fnanchor_32"></a><a href="#footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span> It will be remembered that
the archpriest of letters, Mr. William Wordsworth, once
offered to go over <cite>The Christian Year</cite>, with a view to correcting
the English. To that height Hurrell could not rise.</p>

<p class="unindent">And though I cannot account for the fact, I have been
much more sensible of this since a re-perusal of Genesis.&mdash;I
wrote the foregoing not long after the receipt of your letter,
but have been such a dawdle that I have not been able to
collect materials for finishing it: and the circumstance which
now at last helps me out is a melancholy one, no other than
the decease of our friend and companion Johnny Raw:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_34" id="fnanchor_34"></a><a href="#footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span> who
was taken off, some days since, in the staggers. There was
something peculiarly doleful in the poor fellow’s exit; and
there was a sort of dreariness diffused over all its circumstances,
which set it off with almost a theatrical effect. As B[ob] says,
it would have not been so much if he had wasted away by a
long illness, or if he had heard of his death at a distance;
but to have been using and admiring him till within a few
days of his decease, to have watched all the stages of his rapid
illness, seen him bled, given him his physic (which seemed to
distress him very much, though all along the pain he suffered
was evidently very great), and, after all, to have got up at two
o’clock in the night, when the crisis was to take place, and
come into the stable only a minute after his death, where we
could just see him, by lantern-light, stretched out on the straw:&mdash;were
incidents not calculated to excite pleasure. Add to
this, it was one of those shivering cold stormy nights which
make me feel as if I and the people with me were the only
human beings in the world: a fact, by-the-by, which I am
not yet sufficient psychologist to account for. And the next
day, when we went out to bury him, the weather was just the
<!--058.png--><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pageno">32</span>
same, and there was nothing to excite one cheerful association.
Also, it was somewhat staggering to the speculatively inclined,
not to be able to discover one single reason why he should not
be able to gallop about as well as ever. He was evidently in
good condition, his flesh hard, and his limbs sound: and why
I should be able to walk any better than he, was more than I
could elicit. We buried him under an elm tree in the lawn,
and nailed his shoes to it for a monument.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_35" id="fnanchor_35"></a><a href="#footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>‘… My father has found the <ins title="Eikôn basilikê">Εἰκὼν [βασιλική]</ins> among
some old books, and I have been reading it. It puts me in
mind of a verse in this morning’s Psalms: “Thou shalt
hide me privily by Thine own presence from the provoking of
all men, Thou shalt keep me secretly in Thy tabernacle from
the strife of tongues”; which seems to point out the clearest
and most beautiful instance of the moral government of God
being begun on earth. I should like to know the Hebrew of
the verse before: “O how plentiful is Thy goodness, which
Thou hast prepared for them that trust in Thee <em>even before the
sons of men</em>.” For if “before” means “in the presence of,” then
David is drawing the conclusion I want; but I am afraid it
must mean “greater than falls to the lot of the rest of mankind.” …
Please to look, when you are in a humour for it,
in <cite>Medea</cite>, 705, where Ægeus says, <ins title="eis touto gar dê phroudos eimi pas egô">εἰς τοῦτο γὰρ δὴ φροῦδος εἰμὶ πᾶς ἐγώ</ins>. The commentators cited by Elmsley have
fumbled much about it, and some of them I do not understand;
but may it not mean: “For as to my name continuing
in my posterity, in that respect I am clean gone.” If <ins title="eis touto">εἰς τοῦτο</ins>
will bear this signification, it is certainly prettier than as it is
commonly explained. I like <cite>Hecuba</cite> far better than <cite>Medea</cite>….
Another interval has elapsed, and the leaves, which had held
out surprisingly hitherto, have almost totally disappeared, and
now we may reckon winter to be fairly set in. I wish I could
write verses to perform the obsequies of this delicious summer,
the like of which will probably never visit the abodes of
mortals again….’</p>

At the outset of 1826, Hurrell found at least one modern
book to his liking. This was the <cite>Fragments in Verse and
Prose, by a Young Lady, Miss Elizabeth S&mdash;&mdash; with Some
Account of her Life and Character</cite>, by H[enrietta] M[aria]
Bowdler, a new edition of which, in two volumes octavo, had
just appeared. Elizabeth Smith of Burnhall near Durham,
the Oriental scholar, was born in 1776 and died in 1806.
Our present standard reference, the <cite>Dictionary of National
Biography</cite>, which highly commends her self-won learning and
its methods, adds that ‘her verses have no merit, and her
reflections are of the obvious kind, gracefully expressed.’ But
the reflections do not seem obvious to some readers, save
inasmuch as at first all simple and profound little discoveries
of the sort seem so: which is ever their highest praise. The
book is but poorly representative, and badly put together: it
certainly would give no clear idea, to our own more exacting
public, of a personality full of goodness and charm, nor of a
remarkable mind with a dozen hobbies, and not one affectation.</p>

<p>‘<ins title="Daimonie">Δαιμόνιε</ins>: As I am conscious of being one of those imbecile-minded
people who one day admire a thing as if they could
never think of anything else, and soon after cease to think of it
at all, I must write to you while a little book that I took up
the other day accidentally continues uppermost in my thoughts.
It calls itself <cite>Fragments in Verse and Prose, by a Young Lady</cite>;
and struck with the sentimentality of the title, I took it up to
laugh at it; nor did I find anything in the preface to do away
with my preconceived opinion. But on opening the book at
random, among some fragments extracted from her private
meditations, I began to like her most extremely. The mention
of Piercefield,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_36" id="fnanchor_36"></a><a href="#footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span> and the initials Miss S., made me remember your
having told me of a Miss Smith that lived there, while we were
scrambling up the Windcliff. I am sure if you had admired
her half as much as I do, you would not have let me go till we
had hunted out every corner that she mentions. There is something
to my mind very peculiar in all the turn of her thoughts,
<!--060.png--><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pageno">34</span>
and those half-metaphysical, half-poetical speculations which
almost put me in mind of my mother. Yesterday I mentioned
the book to a person who I was surprised to find knew a great
deal about her, and from whom I was still more astonished to
hear that I myself knew very well indeed her intimate friend
Miss H[unt], to whom most of her letters are addressed….’</p>

<p class="p2">And again, a little later, winding up an intimate letter
in Latin to Keble, there is more of this pleasant heroine-worship,
coupled with some feeling analysis and amusing
self-portrayal. Hurrell’s repugnance to things German were
a foregone conclusion, had he never expressed it.</p>

<p>‘… I could not find the places you referred me to in
Miss Smith, but am happy to find that we sympathise in the
extent of our admiration, if not in the sources; though indeed,
I am willing to believe, both. But as for old Klopstock, I
cannot read about him and his wives;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_37" id="fnanchor_37"></a><a href="#footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></span> and am rather horrified
at Miss S[mith’s] having taken so much trouble about him, or
any other sentimental old German. What makes me admire
Miss S[mith] so excessively, is more than I can give any
intelligible account of: she either does not admire, or is not
acquainted with my favourite books; and those that she
fancies she admires (for I am sure she does it only in
ignorance) are my inveterate enemies. Neither could I fix
upon any passages in her own writings which would seem
to justify me if I quoted them. But somehow I seem perfectly
certain I know her intimately, and that I can trace the feelings
in which all she says and does originates; and all this is so
consistent, as far as it goes, with what I have imaged to myself
as the archetype of human perfection, that I have invested her,
in my imagination, with all its attributes….</p>

<p>‘Lloyd’s<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_38" id="fnanchor_38"></a><a href="#footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></span> immense catalogue of books, that he recommends
as necessary, has frightened me beyond measure: but I am
<!--061.png--><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pageno">35</span>
getting to be of your opinion, that to be fully occupied is almost
necessary, in order to get through life with tolerable ease and
comfort….’</p>

<p class="p2">Says the Editor of the Newman <cite>Correspondence</cite>, in entering
upon the annals of the year 1826: ‘The Oriel election and
Fellowship was this year a momentous one to Mr. Newman,
as bringing him into intimacy with the friend whose influence
he ever felt powerful beyond all others to which he had been
subject.’ Newman writes of the election to his mother on
March 31, 1826, in terms of convinced enthusiasm which are
not unlike Crabb Robinson’s after encountering for the first
time the youthful William Hazlitt. ‘By-the-bye, I have not
told you the name of the other successful candidate:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_39" id="fnanchor_39"></a><a href="#footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></span> Froude
of Oriel. We were in grave deliberation till near two this
morning, and then went to bed. Froude is one of the acutest
and clearest and deepest men in the memory of man. I hope
our election will be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in honorem Dei et sponsæ suæ ecclesiæ
salutem</i>, as Edward <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></span> has it in our Statutes.’ The Oriel
electors had their own standards, and gloried in them. Fellowships
depended hardly at all on the technical and the prescribed;
indications of the scope and accuracy of acquired
knowledge passed for next to nothing; but what did count,
in Oriel’s golden days, was a man’s whole momentum and
equilibrium, his relationship to the intellectual life, his mastery
over his own faculties: ‘not what he had read, but what he
was like.’ Originality, distinction, was the cachet, and Oriel
College was the first in Oxford to throw open her unhampered
Fellowships to the entire University. Like Whately, Thomas
Mozley, and Newman himself, Froude who stood only moderately
high in the books of the University examiners, had been
preferred before candidates who were double-firsts. He took, as
was but natural, an even more rapturous pleasure in the event
than Newman had done. He wrote to Keble, when he was
steadying himself under the impact of a lasting good fortune:</p>

<p><!--062.png--><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pageno">36</span>
‘My dreamy sensations have at length subsided, and I
cannot think how I could have made myself such a fool as to
be so upset! But it was altogether such a surprise to me,
and I knew it would delight my father so much, that I could
not stand it all. I do not mean that when the news was
announced to me I did not contemplate the possibility of it;
for you must know that I am the most superstitious of the
species, and that on the first day of the examination I had a
sort of indescribable sensation from which I augured the
event. But such a confused prophesying as this is so very
different from a sober expectation that it served rather to
increase than to diminish my surprise at its being realised.’</p>

<p>And again, turning from what he thought an almost
unnatural success, he seeks refuge in his own special pun.
‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crede mihi</cite>,’ he confides to Keble on the eve of Candlemas,
‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">idem sum ille <ins title="phroudos">φροῦδος</ins> qui utroque pede claudicans e scholis
evasi: me in nulla re scholastica ex illo tempore usque ad hunc
diem sentio profecisse</cite>.’ In ‘Empty-head’ limping with both feet
out of the Schools, we are to recognise an allusion to Hurrell’s
unforgotten double-second class. He was too humble to see
that for a Romany rye of his sort, a double-second class was
really a quite extravagant toll to pay to University conventions.</p>

<p>Oriel soon became a hotbed of revolution, as the consequence
of her anti-academical processes of selection. Within
two years, troubles began, and Froude, with Newman, R. I.
Wilberforce, and Dornford, the other public Tutors, took up
and for a long time maintained, against the settled paganism
of the College, their own ‘fierce’ views of their duty towards
undergraduates. Of this duty Froude and Newman had a
particularly clear conviction. Keble had struck, and struck
strongly, the pastoral note as early as 1818, and developed
it in a letter to Sir J. T. Coleridge.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_40" id="fnanchor_40"></a><a href="#footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></span> On the other hand, the
Provost and the administrators held that intercourse between
Tutor and pupil should be a routine of lectures only, and not
that and a cure of souls beside. The antagonism lasted for
nearly four years, during which Froude’s deep friendship with
Newman grew up, and was perfected. The end came with
<!--063.png--><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pageno">37</span>
Hawkins’ express refusal to sanction the further supply of
pupils to the would-be spiritual directors who so quietly
defied him. They had ‘led the last struggle for the ancient
quasi-parental and religious character of the College Tutor.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_41" id="fnanchor_41"></a><a href="#footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></span>
As the pupils they had went up for degrees and left the
University, they fell quite idle, in that respect, by 1831, and
with all their smouldering zeal and moral fire within them, the
way was open for another onset of the Laudians which was
destined to affect the consciences not alone of young Oriel, but
of the nation and the age.</p>

<p>Froude’s allotted rooms were directly over Newman’s, in
the Chapel angle of the Great Quad of Oriel College. The
new Fellow did not, as such, come into residence until after the
Easter vacation; during the following month, April, we find
him still luxuriating in Devonshire and plunging deep into
abstract metaphysics. ‘I have been taken with a fit of writing,’
he confesses to Keble. ‘I am happier than I ever was at
Oxford, far: but that is not saying much.’ Apparently, he
had posted manuscripts for criticism, and received it as gratefully
and as combatively as usual. ‘I am infinitely indebted
to you,’ he writes, ‘for your expeditious attention to my
concern, and will try my best to set to rights the places you
row [about]. However, I still maintain that my end is both
relevant and true and my puzzle-headed antithesis a good
one; but I bow my head in implicit confidence, as far as
practice goes. Distinctions and refinements are growing on
me, and I am all in a maze; and it is delightful to have the
shadow of a great rock in a weary land to which I may turn
for temporary shelter. If I had a year more, I could not
make it at all to my satisfaction; so I must make the best
of it.’</p>

<p>His note-books for this year and the next are full of the
contemned ‘distinctions and refinements.’ In trying to beat
out his conceptions of moral growth (a thing he refused to
recognise in himself), he jots down some striking and arresting
thoughts. Two or three which lie metaphysically not
far apart, must suffice for transcription. They show the
<!--064.png--><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pageno">38</span>
coherence, the synthetic power with which Froude’s philosophy
knit all worlds into one.</p>

<p>&mdash;‘For whatever cause the great Author of Nature contrived
that resemblance (as it appears to us) which subsists between
the part of His dominions of which He has given us a consciousness,
and that other part with which we are acquainted
only through our understanding, it seems calculated to assist our
conceptions of the one to observe what passes in the other….
The business of our life seems to be to acquire the habit of
acting as we should do if we were <em>conscious</em> of all that we
<em>know</em>…. It is delightful to see things turn out well whose case
seems in some sort to represent to us our indistinct conceptions
of our own. Animals fainting under the effect of exercise, and
then again recovering their strength which that very exercise
has contributed to increase; the slow and, uncertain degrees in
which this increase is effected, and yet the certainty in which
it is effected: the growth of trees sometimes tossed by winds
and checked by frosts, yet, by the evil effects of these winds,
directed in what quarter to strike their roots so as to secure
themselves for the future, and by these frosts hardened and
fitted for a new progress the next summer:&mdash;in things of this
sort I am so constituted as to see brethren in affliction
evidently making progress towards release.’</p>

<p>&mdash;‘Some people imagine that there is something blasphemous
in the supposition that a finite creature can be conscious in
two places at once. This is so far from being true that even
our own experience contradicts it. Perhaps there is some
absurdity in the very idea which attributes a place to consciousness,
or the things capable of it. With regard to ourselves,
there is nothing to show us <em>where</em> we are conscious
(though most people suppose the conscious thing is somewhere
within the body), or that we may not be with equal propriety
said to be conscious, or, in other words, to <em>be</em>, wherever anything
is of which we are conscious. It seems to me that the
question where we are, is one not of fact, but of degree; and
that the only facts which make us suppose we are where our
body is, give us likewise the same reason for supposing that
in the same sense we sometimes are far away from the body.’</p>

<p>&mdash;‘Yesterday, before breakfast, while the vacancy produced
<!--065.png--><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pageno">39</span>
by fasting was still on me, and I was reading the Psalms, and
craving for a comprehension of the things which I could only
look on as words, and was worked up to such a pitch that I
felt trying to see my soul, and make out how it was fitted to
receive an impression from them,&mdash;Merton bell<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_42" id="fnanchor_42"></a><a href="#footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></span> began to go;
and it struck me (I cannot tell why) that if such a trifle as that
could give me such a vivid idea, my soul must be a most
intricate thing; and that when senses were given to the blind
part of it, what things would those appear, the apprehension of
which I was struggling after! This is as near what passed in
my mind as I can find expressions to shape my memory by.
This blindness of heart is what, by habit and patience, it is our
work practically to remove. We are to shape our souls for its
removal, by making it in harmony with the things invisible.’</p>

<p>These passages mark a great point of divergence between
the writer and the ‘religious genius’ with whom his memory is
identified to all generations. It is something of an anomaly,
even, to find the young Froude, and not the young Newman
(rather the less practical of the practical pair), developing so
strong a habit of purely speculative thought; but it was that
which gave him his silent leadership. He combined with his
turn for abstractions (yet with scorn shared with Newman for
‘formulas which antedate the facts’) an unexpected power of
philosophical application of scientific ideas. All these half-mystical
gymnastics of the reflective faculty are going to tell
in 1833 and after, when the hour of action strikes, and when,
by his already gathered impetus, Hurrell Froude is going to
dart ahead in a still level flight, like a gull’s. He will seem
external, as if talking more than he thinks, talking somewhat
to the bewilderment of those others who can hardly think for
his talking. He will be gay; he will be glib; he will pass
care-free amid the sweat of horses and men, simply because of
these long hard mental vigils, pen in hand, up Oriel Staircase
<abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 3, while he is hearing Merton bell, and trying to see his
soul.</p>

<p>To Keble, who was still at home during the spring of

<!--066.png--><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pageno">40</span>
already conceived so lofty an opinion of him, and had probably
not taken pains to conceal it: the Newman who dearly
loved, to the last, to be ‘disvenerated.’ Many important
Fellows of Oriel, such as Arnold, Hampden, Jelf, Jenkyns,
Pusey, were absent from Oxford: hence they lack mention in
our critic’s roster.</p>

acquainted with him: but he is very shy,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_45" id="fnanchor_45"></a><a href="#footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></span> and dining with a
person now and then does not break the ice so quickly as might
be wished. I venerate [Davison?] but dislike him: I like
[Newman] but disvenerate him. Old [Wilberforce?]<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_46" id="fnanchor_46"></a><a href="#footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></span> is very
funny, good-natured, and, I think, very much improved. And
now for my ill-fated inconsistent self; I have been trying to be
<!--067.png--><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pageno">41</span>
diligent, and have been horribly idle; trying to be contented,
and yet constantly fidgety; trying to be matter-of-fact, and have
nearly cracked myself with conceited metaphysics. This last is
principally attributable to Lucretius, whom I have been reading
with considerable attention, and intense admiration; I shall very
soon have finished him, as I have got on some way in the Sixth
Book. In the end of the Book, about the mortality of the
soul, there are some magnificent extraordinary reflections on
our longings for something indescribable, and beyond our
reach; on our having affections which have no adequate object,
and which we long to forget and smother, because we cannot
gratify them: [reflections] which make a striking preface to
Bishop Butler’s sermons on the Love of God.’</p>

<p class="p2">June 15, 1826, was the five hundredth anniversary of the
foundation of Oriel College. Perhaps the observance of it
served to stimulate Hurrell’s filial piety and his spontaneous
regard for the past. Few Fellows of Colleges, then or since,
‘supinely enjoying the gifts of the Founder,’ as Gibbon says,
would have offered, after such an occasion, this private prayer,
found among Hurrell’s papers:</p>

<p>&mdash;‘Almighty God, Father of all Mercies, I beg to offer Thee
my deep and unfeigned thanks for all the blessings which Thou
hast bestowed upon me; but in addition to those of Thy
favours which I enjoy in common with all mankind, I more
particularly bless Thy Holy Name for those of which I partake
as member of this College; for the means Thou hast given me
of daily sustenance, and of a continual admission to Thy house
and service, through the pious charity of holy men of old. I
bless Thee, O Lord, in that Thou didst put into their heart the
desire of erecting to themselves a memorial, and of leaving to
posterity a great example in the foundation and endowment of
a seminary of religious learning; and I pray Thee that, as it
has fallen to my lot to succeed to this their institution, I may
fulfil my part in it as I believe they would approve if they
could be present with me; that I may not waste in foolish or
gross indulgences the means afforded me of obtaining higher
ends; or allow myself to consider as my own that time which
I receive their wages for dedicating to Thy service, by the
<!--068.png--><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="pageno">42</span>
advancement of useful learning, and adorning the doctrine of
God our Saviour. But more especially do I beg of Thee to
accept my thankfulness for those merciful dispensations of Thy
Providence which affect my lot in particular. That it has
pleased Thee to bring me into the world under the shadow of
my holy mother, in the recollection of whose bright society
Thou hast given me, as it were, a consciousness of that blessedness
which Thou hast taught us to look for in the presence of
Saints and Angels. Also, that my lot has been so cast that I
should fall into the way of one<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_47" id="fnanchor_47"></a><a href="#footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></span> whose good instructions have,
I hope, in some degree, convinced me of the error of my ways,
and may, by Thy grace, serve to reclaim me from them; with
whose high friendship I have most unworthily been honoured,
and in whose presence I taste the cup of happiness.’</p>

<p class="p2">The correspondence with Keble continued implicitly confidential
at all times. But Hurrell writes freely at the close
of his first Long Vacation as Fellow, and after his return to
Oriel, of his scruples and self-dissatisfactions and aspirations:
‘thoughts that do wander through eternity.’</p>

<p>‘It will seem rather pompous to announce my determination
not to rise till I have got a letter written to you; but unless I
start with some such resolution, I shall not be able to get one
written at all. I have made three attempts to write … but
all of them ran off into something wild, which upon reflection I
thought would be better kept to myself. The fact is, that I
have been in a very strange way all the summer, and having
had no one to talk to about the things which have bothered
me, I have been every now and then getting into fits of
enthusiasm or despondency. But the result has been in some
respects a good one, and I have got to take a very great
pleasure in what you recommended to me when we were
together at F[airford], the evening before I left you our first
summer, <i>i.e.</i> good books; and I feel I<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_48" id="fnanchor_48"></a><a href="#footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></span> understand places in
the Psalms in a way I never used to. I go back to Oxford
with a determination to set to at Hebrew and the early Fathers,
<!--069.png--><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pageno">43</span>
and to keep myself in as strict order as I can: a thing which
I have been making ineffectual attempts at for some time, but
which never once entered my head for a long time of my
life….</p>

<p>‘I wish you would say anything to me that you think would
do me good, however severe it may be. You must have
observed many things very contemptible in me, but I know
worse of myself, and shall be prepared for anything. I cannot
help being afraid that I am still deceiving myself about my
motives and feelings, and shall be glad of anything on which
to steady myself. Since I have been here I have been getting
more comfortable than I had been for a good bit, from the
society of I[saac]<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_49" id="fnanchor_49"></a><a href="#footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></span> and P[revost]<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_50" id="fnanchor_50"></a><a href="#footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></span> whom I get to like more
and more every day…. We were to have wandered over
North Wales together, but have been obliged to relinquish that
scheme for this time, and perhaps it is a good thing, as far as
I am concerned, to have a less exciting life for the present. I
have had one bit of romance, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, a walk early in the morning
up the Vale of Rydal to Devil’s Bridge. The W[illiamses]
wanted us to ride, but I thought I should remember it better
by walking…. I shall always like scrambling expeditions as
long as I can recollect ours up the Wye. Those few days seem
like a bright spot in my existence; or perhaps it would be a
more apt similitude to compare it to what you quoted as we
were going in the boat to Tintern: “The shadow of a great
rock in a weary land.”</p>

<p>‘I daresay you will think this letter rather strange, but it
cannot do me any good to bottle everything up; besides, I
think there is no pleasure in letters which do nothing but detail
matters of fact. I should have liked much better to have seen
you; but as I suppose there is no chance of that for some time,
I must make the best of it. When I said that I had taken to
liking good books, I did not mean that I had read many. I
have read over and over again Bishop Taylor’s <cite>Holy Living</cite>
<!--070.png--><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pageno">44</span>
<cite>and Dying</cite>, but till I came here I had not gone farther; since,
I have read five sermons of Bishop Wilson, one on the History
of Christianity, and the others on Profiting by Sermons; also
most of Law’s <cite>Serious Call</cite>, about which I remember what you
said to me three years ago.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_51" id="fnanchor_51"></a><a href="#footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="p2 center">To the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <span class="smcap">John Keble</span>, <abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 5, 1826.</p>

<p>‘It may seem an odd sort of thing to say, but I got from
your letter something more like happiness than I have known
since my mother died. Since that time it seems as if I had
been <ins title="atheos en tô kosmô">ἄθεος ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ</ins>; but I hope I may yet get right at
last. It is a great comfort to find so many expressions in the
Psalms like “O tarry thou the Lord’s leisure,” as they serve
to keep up the hope that, weary and unsatisfactory as are my
attempts to be religious, they may in time “comfort my heart.”
And now I can talk to you about myself, I feel a sort of
security against bewildering my mind with vague thoughts,
which I did not know where to check, because I could not get
anyone to sympathise with them at all.</p>

<p>‘I have borrowed Mr. Bonnell’s <cite>Life</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_52" id="fnanchor_52"></a><a href="#footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></span> and have got about
two-thirds through it. I did not at first like the plan you
recommended to me about reveries, as I had been directing all
my actions with a view to fitting myself for realising my
reveries. But it is a wretched unsatisfactory pursuit, for
besides that it does not seem to have any real religion in it,
I have often felt as if I had lost myself, and that I was acting
blindly, without a drift. It is much better to give up all
notion of guiding myself, and “seek first the kingdom of God
and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added.”
I beg your pardon for putting before you the roundabout
fantastic methods to which I have been resorting to arrive at
<!--071.png--><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pageno">45</span>
a plain simple truth that ought to have come at once; but
perhaps they may serve to show the state of my mind better
than any direct description I could give. It is very frightful
to see people like Mr. Bonnell so alarmed about themselves,
and expressing so strongly the wretchedness of their moral
condition. It seems as if, to a fellow like me, it must always
be presumptuous not to despair. The evening before last I
was much struck with a thought in the beginning of Hooker’s
Preface to the <cite>Ecclesiastical Polity</cite>, about not permitting
thoughts to pass away as in a dream. It seems as if people
might make so much more out of their lives by keeping records
of them….</p>

<p>‘I will write you down some horridly-expressed verses
which call themselves to the tune of “Allan Water” and
“Rousseau’s Dream”; the first sketched in autumn, 1825, but
undergoing changes for a long time, poor as is the result;
the second written at W[illiams’s]. I have not shown them to
anyone, and they may give you a sort of guess at the things
my mind has been running upon.’</p>

<p>Froude at this time was associating a good deal with Blanco
White, the Anglicised Spaniard and ex-priest who came to
Oriel, aged fifty-one, when Tyler left it, and deeply interested
Oriel men with his knowledge of the scholastic philosophy.

For some three years he was in great repute among them:
his mental gifts were invalidated to them, later, by his aimlessness
and instability. To his practical acquaintance with the
Roman Breviary, often demonstrated in his own rooms, after
dinner, to Froude, Newman, Pusey, and Wilberforce, Hurrell
owed much, especially in conjunction with the able lectures on
liturgical subjects being delivered by Dr. Lloyd.</p>

<p>Hurrell’s most intimate letter of all those addressed to
Keble, beating and surging with the pathos which is inseparable
from a young man’s interior life, ends sadly and bravely
on <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 8, 1827:</p>

<p>‘I am glad of your advice about penance, for my spirit was
so broken down that I had no vigour to go on even with the
trifling self-denials I had imposed on myself; besides, I feel
that though it has in it the colour of humility, it is in reality
the food of pride. Self-imposed, it seems to me quite different
from when imposed by the Church; and even fasting itself, to
weak minds, is not free from evil, when, however secretly it is
done, one cannot avoid the consciousness of being singular….
I have not much more to say, and when anything comes over
me, will put it down on a large sheet, and send it off when it
is full. I am so very unequal to my feelings, that sometimes
I suspect all to be hypocrisy; but the tide has by this time so
often returned after its ebbing, that finding myself again on
the dry land does not make me so much doubt the reality of
all His waves and storms which have gone over me.’</p>

<p>To his dear Robert Isaac Wilberforce, an approaching guest,
Hurrell indites on the same day a more mundane theme:</p>

<p>‘I must prepare you to find me a great humbug about
cock-shooting; for, though I will not recede from my assertions
concerning the pre-eminent qualifications of our woods in that
line, yet, as our sporting establishment does not go beyond the
bare appointments for what Bob calls hedge-popping, the
vicinity of the cocks will serve no other purpose than to make
you feel more acutely the disadvantages of a connection with
such unknowing people.’</p>

<p>His Tutorship was not an unmixed enjoyment to him,
after taking his <abbr title="Master of Arts">M.A.</abbr> Of it he writes thus seriously, humbly,
and characteristically:</p>

<p class="p2 center"><!--074.png--><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pageno">48</span>
To the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <span class="smcap">John Keble</span>, <abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 23, 1827.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps it may amuse you to hear something of my
proceedings in my new line of life. I have six Lectures in
all: three each day…. I have now got through two days
and seen the general aspect of affairs, and as yet no liberties
have been taken with me, to my knowledge: however, this is
the thing against which I endeavour to arm myself, and from
which I expect a fruitful harvest of moral discipline. I look
upon it as one of the best opportunities which can be given me
to put my elements into order and harmony. It is a quick
and efficacious refreshment to me to think of the south-westerly
waves roaring round the Prawle after our stern, or the little
crisp breakers that we cut through, when you cruised with us
off Dartmouth Harbour. Somehow or other, without having
exposed myself that I know of, in any flagrant way, there
remains upon my mind a more vivid impression of my incompetence
than I expected to await my entrance into the
office. I feel called on to act a part for which neither my
habits nor my studies have fitted me. I am, and always
have been, childishly alive to the pain of being despised, and I
cannot but feel that I have not the sort of knowledge to give
me any command over the men’s attention, or even power of
benefiting the attentive; and, if it was not that I know how
good it is for myself, I believe I should give it up at once!…
Two more tedious days are over; I am not a bit
more in love with my occupation, so that this letter, instead
of suggesting to you some ludicrous ideas and reminiscences,
will terminate in a concatenation of dolefulness, and ask for
a consolatory answer.</p>

<p>‘Lloyd gave us his introductory Lecture to-day, <i>i.e.</i>, settled
the books we were to do, and the times of coming, and was
very good-natured, as usual, in his reception of all of us. I am
afraid my time and spirits will be so much drawn upon in
another quarter, that I shall not have much left of either for
him. Otherwise an historical account of the Liturgy, tracing
all the prayers, through the Roman Missals and Breviaries, up
to their original source, for one Lecture, and the Epistle to the
Romans and First of Corinthians for the other, would be a very
<!--075.png--><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><span class="pageno">49</span>
eligible subject to spend a good deal of time on…. I go
to the Tyrolese singers, who perform some national music in
the Town-Hall at eight o’clock. I hope they will help to lull
me into a momentary forgetfulness; and that I may dream
myself among lakes and mountains, far, far away from the
vulgar crowd.’</p>

<p class="p2">Hurrell’s forecast that his time and spirits would be drawn
upon to the detriment of his studies, was due to the anxiety
he began to feel about his brother Robert. The latter had
followed Hurrell to Oriel in 1822, and graduated B.A. on the
8th of June, 1826. Ardent and active in everything, he had
taken a chill during that Long Vacation, after a particularly long
pull at sea, and the chill was to terminate only in consumption.</p>

<p class="p2 center">To the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <span class="smcap">John Keble</span>, New Year’s Day, 1828.</p>

<p>‘… I wish I could write verses! and then I should make
an attempt to perpetuate in my mind the notions that came
into it the other day at seeing the dead body of a poor woman
who for the last two years has been in a state of intense bodily
suffering, from which she was released a few days since. I do
not recollect having seen her before her illness; but while she
was alive I had never seen her free from the expression of dull
pain; and her face was distorted by a sore wound, which never
healed, on the side of her mouth. But the morning after her
death there was such a quiet careworn beauty on her
countenance, that it seemed to me as if good spirits had been
ornamenting her body at last, to show that a friend of theirs
had inhabited it. I am willing to hope that the recollection of
it may be a help to me in fits of scepticism, when everything
seems so tame and commonplace.’</p>

<p class="p2">These serious thoughts haunted Hurrell at home where
his brother’s health was failing day by day. ‘Bob’ had the
chief share of the physical beauty and vitality of the family.
One who knew him well has preserved an anecdote of his
lovable mischief.</p>

<p>‘The richness and melody of Copleston’s<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_55" id="fnanchor_55"></a><a href="#footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></span> voice surpassed
<!--076.png--><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pageno">50</span>
any instrument…. It was no small part of the daily
amusement of the undergraduates to repeat what Copleston had
said, and just as he said it, and to vary it from their own boyish
imaginations…. The second of the four Froudes, who died
young, made this a special study. Coming out of Tyler’s room
after a Lecture, he tapped gently at the door, and said in the
exact Copleston tone: “Mr. Tyler, will you please step out a
moment?” Tyler rushed out, exclaiming: “My dear Mr.
Provost!” but only saw the tail of the class descending the
staircase. “You silly boys, you’ve been playing me a trick!”
was all that he could say.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_56" id="fnanchor_56"></a><a href="#footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The wheel of fortune brought the Provostship of Oriel not
to ‘an angel,’ John Keble, but to Edward Hawkins, on the
promotion of Copleston to the See of Llandaff, early in this
year. A letter of Froude’s to him has been preserved. There
is an entry in the former’s Diary, under date of <abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 22, 1826,
thus printed: ‘Promised &mdash;&mdash; I would not vote against him
if ever he stood for the &mdash;&mdash;. Foolish: but I must abide by
it.’ Hawkins and James Endell Tyler were the two among
the Fellows who had for years set their hearts upon the
Provostship. Tyler lost his chance when he left Oriel during
the autumn for the living of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Giles-in-the-Fields, London,
where Endell Street, W.C., yet preserves his name. Either to
him, or to Hawkins, Hurrell had hastily pledged his word.
But when he wrote the following letter he was quite aware
of Mr. Keble’s definite withdrawal from the candidacy which
was not yet announced. As a matter of fact, Mr. Keble had
never consented to come forward, and his disciple’s course
became, thereby, easy as well as plain.</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">My dear Hawkins</span>,&mdash;Though I don’t set so high a

letter by making a more formal declaration of my unconditional
and uncompromising determination to rank myself
among your retainers. I am really very sorry that my stupid
delay in answering your letter should have caused you any
bother (to use a studiously elegant expression, than which I
cannot hit on a better): and this is the more provoking, as
I actually had written you an answer the first day; but as I
said something at the end of it about my brother, which
afterwards I thought too gloomy, and which, I believe, was
suggested by seeing him look particularly unwell from some
accident, I thought it rather too hard to call on you for
sympathy in my capricious fancies. I suppose I may take
the liberty to enclose this in a cover to the Bishop, otherwise
I should hesitate to draw on your purse as well as your time
for such a scribble as this. However, I have left you enough
clear paper at the end to work out a question in algebra, or
make the skeleton of a sermon! And as this is probably

<p class="p2">For poor ‘Bob’ Froude, full of frolic and power, the

<p>‘… I have not much spirits to write to you, but will not
allow my promise to go for nothing. When I first came home
I found my brother very much emaciated and enfeebled, but
not quite so far gone as I had been prepared for. But since I
have been here his disorder has been making very rapid
progress indeed…. From what I had heard at Oxford, I
almost doubted I might not find all over before my arrival:
and the relief which I felt when, on getting off the coach at
Totnes, I heard from my father that, not a quarter of an hour
before, he<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_58" id="fnanchor_58"></a><a href="#footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></span> had driven in to meet me, was so great as almost to
unsettle my resolution. So that now the near prospect of a
<!--078.png--><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pageno">52</span>
conclusion is rather hard to face. Even so late as yesterday
evening I began a letter to you, in which I expressed a hope
that when Monday came my brother and I might not part for
ever, but that he would be alive on my return for the Long
Vacation. But the medical person who has attended him told
me, just now, that unless he was relieved from his present
oppression, forty-eight hours would end him. In this state I
really do not think that the [Oriel] election has claims on me
so great as those which retain me here; and, unless his illness
take some unexpected turn, I shall write to [the Provost] in a
day or two, to apologise for absenting myself. I cannot,
indeed, flatter myself that any turn will long retard the
encroachment of the disorder; but, unless appearances
decidedly indicated that, by staying out the Vacation, I should
see all, I think it would be foolish to shrink from my business;
for, when the time of parting came, it would be worse a fortnight
hence than now…. I have known enough of myself
to foresee the return of all my fretfulness and absurdity,
when I leave this enchanted atmosphere. I hope you will
excuse my not writing a longer letter; for most things now
seem insipid to me, except such as I have no right to inflict
upon you. So good-bye, my dear [Robert], for the present,
and do not expect to see me till the beginning of Term. I
should very much wish to take my part in the election, and
do not even now wholly abandon the idea. For I know that
active occupation is the best resource, and I shall not shrink
from it merely to indulge my feelings.’</p>

<p>‘… The feelings under which I wrote to you last, were,
as you say, like the effect of a stunning blow, and I was quite
surprised, myself, how quickly they evaporated. I cannot
indeed call them either groundless or irrational, and I am, in
some respects, not contented at being so soon released from
them. Yet many things have occurred to me, which, even to
my reason, have made things seem better than they did at
first. The more I think of B[ob], the more I am struck with
his singleness of heart, and the low estimation in which he held
himself. I have found, too, some things which he had written,
<!--079.png--><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pageno">53</span>
which I regret much that he had not shown me, which give
me almost assurance that he was farther advanced in serious
feeling, and had taken greater pains to fight against himself
than anyone supposed. Among others, there is one which
seems to me quite beautiful, On the Legitimate Use of
Pleasure; which he has headed with: “My opinion, June,
1827. I wonder what it will be next year.” It is well
arranged as a composition, quite elegant in the language, and
shows that he must have thought over the <cite>Ethics</cite> in a common-sense
way, and compared it with Bishop Butler. I had often
heard him say what a fool he used to be in thinking that the
<cite>Ethics</cite> was only something to be got up, and something quite
irrelevant to actual conduct…. But I feel now as if I had
been conversing with a person, who, if he had not much undervalued
himself, would never have deferred to me….’</p>

<p>‘I have just torn up a letter which I began for you the
other day, and fear that you will have cause to wonder how I
could reserve this for a better destiny. For the fact is, that I
seem to myself to become duller as I grow older, and to have
acquired a fustiness independent of place and occupation, an
inherent fustiness which idleness cannot blow away nor variety
obliterate…. I fear from what I hear of C[hurton]<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_59" id="fnanchor_59"></a><a href="#footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></span> that the
chance of his recovery is at present very slender. His brother

we reckoned the best suited<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_60" id="fnanchor_60"></a><a href="#footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></span> to complaints of that description,
as his enfeebled state put his going abroad out of the question.
But I know from experience how little Devonshire air can do
… I myself am still, as I indeed have been for a long time,
perfectly well. But I find the freshness which at first resulted
from a relaxation from College discipline now gradually
<!--080.png--><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pageno">54</span>
wearing out; and as the images of impudent undergraduates
fade away from the field of my fancy, and the consciousness of
what I am released from becomes less vivid, a new host of
evil genii take possession of the deserted spot. Till within
this last week or so, I felt quite differently from what I ever
used to, and reckoned myself to have become quite a cheerful
fellow; but now I begin to see with my old eyes, and to feed
upon the dreams of faëryland.</p>

<p>‘… I have long been meditating a letter to you, and have
put it off from day to day, in hopes that when the fine weather
should come at last, it might rekindle in me some spark of
poetical feeling. But I was thinking over with myself last
night how I could scrape up a verse or two in honour of this
long-wished-for revolution, and was, after some fruitless pains,
obliged to abandon the undertaking. It is a melancholy fact,
yet full often does it force itself upon me, and in too unquestionable
a shape, that I get stupider as I get older; and
that I either never was what I used to think myself, or that
Nature has recalled her misused favours! In vain is it that
night after night I have tried to peep through the clouds at
Lyra and Cassiopeia, as they chase one another round the
pole, and that I have got up at three to see Mercury rise, when
he was at his longest distance from the sun; and that I have
sailed to Guernsey on a fine day and come back on a finer,
when the waves washed in on the deck as each passed in
succession; and that (when for a short time off the island in a
<!--081.png--><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pageno">55</span>
calm) I found the latitude within a minute by taking the sun’s
meridian altitude, and that I have seen him rise out of the
water, cut in two by the horizon as sharp as a knife. “This
brave o’erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with
golden fire,&mdash;what seemeth it to me but a pestilent congregation
of vapours?” I can partly account for it from the fact
that we are so uncommonly comfortable and cosy here, and
quite agree with you, that “home by mazy streams” is not the
most bracing school in which the recipient of habits can be
disciplined.</p>

<p>‘Then, henceforth, hail! ye impudent undergraduates:
<ins title="geuesthe, mê pheidesthe">γεύεσθε, μὴ φείδεσθε</ins>.’</p>

<p class="p2">‘I heard from N[ewman] the other day, with the testimonials,’
he adds, a little later. ‘… He is a fellow that I
like the more, the more I think of him; only I would give a
few odd pence if he were not a heretic!’ This in reference to
Newman’s early Evangelicalism, not yet sloughed away. As
between Froude and Newman, so between Newman and Pusey,
affection appears to have preceded perfect intellectual confidence.
There is a parallel thought, in more sedate dress, in
Newman’s private journal of May 17, 1823: ‘That Pusey is
Thine, O Lord, how can I doubt? … yet I fear he is prejudiced
against Thy children…. Lead us both on in the way
of Thy commandments!’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_61" id="fnanchor_61"></a><a href="#footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></span> Hurrell quickly came to a correct
reading of Newman, and he presently made sure that his beloved
Keble should share it too. He said once, when conversation
ran on the traits of undoubted excellence in criminal characters:
‘Were I asked what good deed I had ever done, I should say
that I had brought Keble and Newman to understand each
other.’ That mutual love, indeed, despite a long parting,
never wavered. There is an odd little footnote to be gathered
from Mr. Anthony Froude’s ‘Oxford Counter-Reformation.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_62" id="fnanchor_62"></a><a href="#footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></span>
He is speaking of events subsequent to 1845.</p>

<p>‘My eldest brother had left to us younger ones, as a
characteristic instruction, that if we ever saw Newman and
<!--082.png--><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="pageno">56</span>
Keble disagree, we might think for ourselves. The event
which my brother had thought as impossible as that a double
star should fly asunder in space, had actually occurred. We
had been floated out into mid-ocean upon the Anglo-Catholic
raft, buoyed up by airy bubbles of ecclesiastical sentiment.
The bubbles had burst, the raft was splintered, and we&mdash;I
mean my other brother and myself&mdash;were left, like Ulysses,
struggling in the waves.’</p>

<p>Says Mr. Thomas Mozley,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_63" id="fnanchor_63"></a><a href="#footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></span> referring to this time, and to
tastes shared in common among Oriel men: ‘I think we all of
us found it easier to admire and even to criticise, than to
design. Keble, Froude, and Ogilvie undertook a memorial of
William Churton, to be placed in <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary’s. It was to be
simple, modest, and unobtrusive, like the subject. Whether
the result carried out this idea, I leave others to say,’ If we
are to judge from a letter of Hurrell’s addressed to Keble, the
first design emanated from Newman, though drawn by himself.
‘I don’t make much progress in my design for C[hurton’s]
monument,’ he writes on May 23, 1829. ‘O[gilvie] decides on
its being Gothic; and if this is the case, it will never do to let
it take its chance in the hands of a statuary.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_64" id="fnanchor_64"></a><a href="#footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></span> Yet the
responsibility of doing it one’s self makes me so fastidious that
I cannot settle on anything,’ He had thought of falling back
upon ‘the sort of niches which are used to hold statues of
saints, or [stoups for] holy water: somehow it does not seem
quite congruous to make one of these merely to frame an
inscription.’ However, he draws a narrow pointed arch over
a tall pedestal supporting a plain cross, on the suggestion of
Newman, adding that he likes it especially, though it may be
a bit eccentric.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_65" id="fnanchor_65"></a><a href="#footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></span> ‘It is to stand in the wall over one of the
doorways, between the blank window on the south side, and
the window in which the gallery terminates. This is meant
to be represented standing under an arch cut out in the wall.’
There were not many Englishmen attempting Early English
decoration in 1829. The memorial to William Ralph Churton,
<!--083.png--><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pageno">57</span>
Fellow of Oriel, aged twenty-seven, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phthisi eheu præreptus</i>, is
to be found in <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary’s Church, though not in the position
allotted it in this letter; and the big ugly white sarcophagus
with fussy details in high relief on a grey ground is certainly
no design of Hurrell Froude’s.</p>

<p>Froude’s intimate correspondence with Newman began in
1828, their friendship having been forming since 1826. To
all to whom the latter spoke or wrote with affection, as Miss
Mozley reminds us, he was ever open and confiding. ‘But
there is distinction in his confidences. Thus to his mother he
writes what it would not occur to him to say to anyone else:
experiences, sensations, and odd encounters; dreams, fancies,
and passing speculations: while to Hurrell Froude, on another
field altogether, there is the same absolute trust, and unlocking
of the heart.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_66" id="fnanchor_66"></a><a href="#footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes, in the early letters, the correspondent at
Dartington feels impelled to continue his autobiography, in
default of anything better to deal with. ‘When I come to
consider my resources,’ he says in his smiling mock-grandiose
way, ‘I feel that they will not prove commensurate with my
malignity, and that I shall not be able even to bore you with
success.’</p>

<p>‘Since I left Oxford, little has happened to me, and still
less have I done. I have indeed written two sermons, and
they lasted near twenty minutes, so that I may hope to get
on. But the time that they took me is quite absurd, and that
which they gave me an excuse for wasting, under the plea of
thought, grotesque indeed. Also, the paper that I wasted on
things that turned out to have no reference to the subject
would form a distinct object of contemplation; and after all,
when I came to preach them, they seemed so rambling and
incomplete that I could not fancy, while I was reading them,
how anyone could possibly follow me. Besides this, I have
done nothing except getting my equatorial put up and
adjusted in our garden, and trying provoking experiments on
the insensibility of my hearing organs. I find the summit of
<!--084.png--><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pageno">58</span>
perception to which I can attain is to observe that a note
harmonises better with its octave, twelfth, and fifth, than with
their next-door neighbours. I also can acknowledge a discord
in a deuce<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_67" id="fnanchor_67"></a><a href="#footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></span> and a seventh; but as for knowing one from the
other, unless they come very close on each other, it passes my
comprehension how man can do it…. I am quite ashamed
of the length of time this has been on the stocks, and of the
shabby performance which it turns out. Alas, it is a sad
reflection that I am condemned to retrograde in all respects:
to find no resting-place for my self-complacency either in my
intellectual, moral, or corporeal prowess, and notwithstanding
to be as conceited as ever!’</p>

<p>This was a note of needless dissatisfaction only too sincere,
repeated in Keble’s ear. ‘As for me, I despair of ever becoming
a scholar or mathematician either, beyond just enough
to amuse myself when I am a solitary country Curate….’</p>

<p class="p2">1829 is a silent year with Hurrell, on the whole. He had
lost his beloved brother, and he was preparing for his own
Ordination. In the late summer he paid his first visit to his
cousins at Keswick.</p>

<p>‘The evening I received your criticisms I wrote you three
sides of a letter, and did not send it, only because I thought
time would produce things better worth writing: and now I
am so changed in position and circumstances I think I may as
well begin again. So all I will retain of my former letter is
a criticism on <cite>The Christian Year</cite>, suggested by a very
tempestuous night, in which all our party were crossing the
Channel in a pilot-boat. You must not say “the wild wind
rustles in the <em>piping</em> shrouds”:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_68" id="fnanchor_68"></a><a href="#footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></span> shrouds never “pipe” when

occasions when it is more sublime than comfortable to be a

description of the scene I witnessed, and the night I spent on
deck: but I doubt not you will willingly take all this for

Cumberland. [Dornford?]<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_69" id="fnanchor_69"></a><a href="#footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></span> made me stay some time in Dublin,
which was my first stage, and is, in point of time, much the
nearest way: and also sent me into the north of Ireland after
Captain Mudge, who is surveying the coast. In my hunt for
him, I saw the Giants’ Causeway, every stone of which is beset
by some fellow who claims a fee for describing it. It is certainly
well worth seeing; but you can conceive nothing so perfectly
unlike any of the pretended representations of it. I made two
bad drawings there, which will serve to keep it in my own
mind, but will do little to illuminate mankind at large. I am

<p class="unindent">and immediately hired a horse, to start the next morning at
five to see it. I was most unlucky in my day, as it had been
fine for the preceding week, and only set in for rain when
I got among the Wicklow mountains. I had a very wild
romantic uncomfortable ride through a wholly uninhabited
country, till I got within the baleful influence of lionisers,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_70" id="fnanchor_70"></a><a href="#footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></span>
and was pestered out of my wits by humbugging guides who
dinned into my ears miserable expansions of Tom Moore’s
note about <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kevin, till I was quite out of patience. The
day was so misty that it was only once or twice that I could
make out the scene distinctly, and so constantly raining, that
all my paper was soaked in trying to draw what I could make
out. By dint of perseverance, I crawled into poor <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kevin’s<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_71" id="fnanchor_71"></a><a href="#footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></span>
cell, which is hardly large enough to coil one’s self up in,
<!--086.png--><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pageno">60</span>
and when I was there hardly a square foot of it was dry: so
the day answered the purpose, at any rate, of showing me
that there is a dark side to a hermit’s existence. He had
chosen himself a most picturesque rocky point, which projects
a little into the Lake, with one or two hollies and mountain
ashes growing up in its crevices; and cut out a cell for himself
in its perpendicular face. It would take too much space
to describe the grand gloom of the Lake, the seven ruined
Churches on its borders (one of which is still a burial-ground
for the Roman Catholics), and that extraordinary Tower, a relic
of paganism, which stands in one of the churchyards.</p>

<p>‘I am now on the bank of the Lake by which my mother
was brought up, and of which I used to hear over and over
again. It has been much altered by Macadamisers, and the
house she lived in has been sold. Houses seem to have
sprung up about Keswick Lake as if it was a Torquay or
Sidmouth; and new dandy names have been given to all the
creeks and islands, and nothing but gaiety seems to be going
on or thought of. But I suppose old Skiddaw looks pretty
much the same as he used to do, and will see things go to pot
with their predecessors…. I hope in a day or two to
find out the Parish Register, and see her birth and marriage:
which is something like poring over the name of a place one
likes in a map….’</p>

<p class="p2">The home of Margaret Spedding’s childhood, Armathwaite
Hall, is within six miles of Cockermouth, the birthplace of
Wordsworth. It stands at the foot of Bassenthwaite Lake,
and looks out towards some of the loveliest and best-known
mountains of the district, including Skiddaw, Helvellyn, and
the Borrowdale Hills. It had been sold to Sir Frederick Vane,
<abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr>, of Hutton Hall, Penrith, in 1796. Hurrell was a guest
at Mirehouse, where his cousin John Spedding was always from
time to time entertaining some of the noted literary men of
the period.</p>

<p>To Newman, on <abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 27, 1829, he writes more of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Kevin’s dismal and delightful habitation, and ends with the
praises of his mother’s county. ‘I got to Cumberland about
ten days since, and I can safely assert that it exceeds anything
<!--087.png--><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pageno">61</span>
that imagination can conjure up. I don’t mean that the extensive
views of lake and mountain are so especially splendid, for,
when the scene is on so large a scale, the trees and rocks become
deplorably insignificant, woods seem little better than furze
brakes; but, in rambling along the brooks and waterfalls, one
comes to such excessively romantic corners, that they have
quite put me out of love with Devonshire. The only thing
which I desiderate is a Church steeple here and there in the
valleys; for the worst of it is, that very few of the Parish
Churches here are in exterior little better than a decent
barn. What a horrid-looking scribble this is! and I know it
is full of false spellings of all sorts, which will in many places
make it unintelligible.’</p>

<p>All was grist which came to this preoccupied critic’s mill.
He had an unaffected fondness for the classics. His theory
about the poet whom he loved and understood best, and whom
he is always quoting, is that he was a shy pastoral lyrist driven
by officious friends into the epic field. Says Newman in a
passing note of interest: ‘It was [Froude’s] notion that
Horace and others used to (what is now called) patronise
Virgil, as a man who really had a great deal in him; but who,
the pity was, would not conform himself to the habits of
society, and so lost opportunities of influence. So they set
him upon the <cite>Æneid</cite>, to make something of him.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_72" id="fnanchor_72"></a><a href="#footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></span></p>

no fewer than twenty appear complete in the <cite>Remains</cite>, are to
a reader searching, pitiless, unforgetable. The undergraduate,

Polignac in their disasters, and growling over Whig successes in
England, is too amusing to be omitted. ‘… I set out in the rain

might before I had another opportunity. I got to Exeter, went
to the dentist, had the forceps applied: the top of the tooth
broke; they were applied again: a splinter came out of the

the nerve had come away in the fragments. Nothing remained

jam pridem sanguine fuso</cite>”: I had satisfied my debt to my
future self; and the present self might be excused from further
suffering, till the toothache actually came.’</p>

<p class="p2">Froude’s lecturing at Oxford was now quite done;
Newman’s and Robert Wilberforce’s likewise; they resigned
their Tutorships as gracefully as they might, being
joyful over the turn things had taken. The long opposition
maintained against their desire to arrange the
terminal table in accordance with their own best judgment,
ended in total defeat for ‘the erect fighting figures’ of the
three friends. The Provost himself, Hampden, Denison, and
the junior Copleston rushed into the breach with Lectures
many and purposeful; but Oriel felt the change, whether for
good or ill, to be a real crisis. According to one distinguished
commentator, her regeneration dates from that day; according
to another, she never recovered the loss, and could but suffer
her scholarly pre-eminence to pass, gradually but surely, to
Balliol, which has ever since held it. Two at least of
the dispossessed Tutors had conceived already a wider field
of action for their energies. They had leisure now to think
and to write; and leisure bred consequences. ‘Humanly
speaking,’ Newman assures us, in his fragment of autobiography,
<!--089.png--><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pageno">63</span>
written throughout in the third person, ‘the Movement
never would have been, had they not been deprived of the
Tutorship, or had Keble, not Hawkins, been Provost.’</p>

<p>Newman made a proposal that Robert Wilberforce or Froude
should join him in the care of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary’s parish, or rather, in building
up at Littlemore what the Vicar ultimately intended even
then should become a separate parish: but neither saw his
way to accept the work. From letters of this time we gather
knowledge of their ever-increasing attention to the Fathers; to
the ethical aspects of many great political questions; and to the
country walks and rides, apart or together, which did so much
to strengthen that pure passion for Nature, ‘subdued and
cherished long,’ which in Newman, as in Froude, lent sweetness
and balance to character. Froude’s heartfelt love of Devon is
conspicuous, whether he be in it or away from it. During
the Long Vacation of 1831, he succeeded in carrying Newman
off from his books and the stuffy summer air of low-lying
Oxford, to the delights of Dartington. As a glowing corroboration
of what Hurrell himself was always writing, it is
worth while to quote his friend’s description of the district,
sent to his interested mother at Iffley.</p>

<p class="quotesig">‘Dartington, July 7, 1831.</p>

<p>‘I despatched a hasty letter yesterday from Torquay which
must have disappointed you from its emptiness; but I wished
you to know my progress. As we lost sight of the Needles,
twilight came on, and we saw nothing of the coast. The night
was beautiful, and on my expressing an aversion to the cabin,
Froude and I agreed to sleep on deck…. When I awoke, a
little before four, we were passing the Devonshire coast, about
fifteen miles off it. By six we were entering Torbay….
Limestone and sandstone rocks of Torbay are very brilliant
in their colours and sharp in their forms; strange to say, I
believe I never saw real rocks before, in my life! This
consciousness keeps me very silent, for I feel I am admiring
what everyone knows, and it is foolish to observe upon. You
see a house said to have belonged to Sir Walter Ralegh;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_73" id="fnanchor_73"></a><a href="#footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></span>
<!--090.png--><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pageno">64</span>
what possessed him to prefer the court at Greenwich to a spot
like this?… I know I am writing in a very dull way, but can
only say that the extreme deliciousness of the air, and the
fragrance of everything makes me languid, indisposed to speak
or write, and pensive. My journey did not fatigue me, to
speak of, and I have no headache, deafness, or whizzing in my
ears; but, really, I think I should dissolve into essence of roses,
or be attenuated into an echo, if I lived here!… What strikes
me most is the strange richness of everything. The rocks
blush into every variety of colour, the trees and fields are
emeralds, and the cottages are rubies. A beetle I picked up
at Torquay was as green-and-gold as the stone it lay upon,
and a squirrel which ran up a tree here just now was not the
pale reddish-brown to which I am accustomed, but a bright
brown-red. Nay, my very hands and fingers look rosy, like
Homer’s Aurora, and I have been gazing on them with astonishment.
All this wonder I know is simple; and therefore, of
course, do not you repeat it. The exuberance of the grass
and the foliage is oppressive, as if one had not room to breathe,
though this is a fancy. The depth of the valleys and the
steepness of the slopes increase the illusion, and the Duke of
Wellington would be in a fidget to get some commanding
point to see the country from. The scents are extremely
fine, so very delicate yet so powerful; and the colours of
the flowers as if they were all shot with white. The sweet
peas especially have the complexion of a beautiful face:
they trail up the wall, mixed with myrtles, as creepers.
As to the sunset, the Dartmoor heights look purple, and
the sky close upon them a clear orange. When I turn
back and think of Southampton Water and the Isle of Wight,
they seem, by contrast, to be drawn in Indian ink, or
pencil. Now I cannot make out that this is fancy, for why
should I fancy? I am not especially in a poetic mood. I
have heard of the brilliancy of Cintra and still more of the
East, and I suppose that this region would pale beside them;
yet I am content to marvel at what I see, and think of
Virgil’s description of the purple meads of Elysium. Let
me enjoy what I feel, even though I may unconsciously
exaggerate.’</p>

Newman’s senses were extraordinarily delicate: he writes
as if at thirty he was half unaware of some of his most
special faculties.</p>

<p>A week later, a postscript follows, addressed to Harriett
Newman, telling of ‘a sermon to write for to-morrow, which
I do believe to be as bad a one as I have ever written, for I
was not in the humour; but I do not tell people so. It may
do good, in spite of me!’ and this confidence: ‘The other day
the following lines came into my head. They are not worth
much; but I transcribe them:</p>

<p>There was a lifelong strife in Newman’s mind between
created and Uncreated Beauty, or rather, a lifelong choice.
He seems to have felt that he could not be as much of a
poet as his own heart prompted, and be also as much of a
hard-working saint as Divine Grace called him to be. For
him, as in the beginning, a loved landscape was ‘pagan’: a
temptation towards false gods. How little his attitude was
understood, during his life, is well illustrated by the published
complaint of Mr. Aubrey de Vere that his friend Dr. Newman
of the Catholic University would never make time to go driving
with him through the exquisite scenery about Dublin, though
invited again and again. In all this, as in much else, he was
entirely Augustinian. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ejiciebas eas et intrabas pro eis.</i> It
does not seem clear that Hurrell Froude, who outran Newman
in many austerities, shared fully in the exercise of this signal
one. His loneliness of spirit, far more developed than his
friend’s, was also far less conscious, and his boyish relish of
the beauties of moor and sea based itself, rather, on a
<!--092.png--><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pageno">66</span>
philosophy which was Keble’s, and Henry Vaughan’s long
before him:</p>

<p>Certainly, Newman was never so tormented by his affection
for music, or for anything else in the same class, as he was
by the glamour of out-of-doors at Taormina, and the homelier
charms of ‘Devon in her most gentle dimplement.’ Spiritual
matters apart, one does not perceive what else could have
inwrought him more effectually with the very fibres of Hurrell’s
being, than his felt infatuation for the Dartington he visited
but twice in his busy life. They shared the same passion, again,
for Rome. The spirit of place can always create a final test
between any two cultivated minds. To differ in kind or even
in degree of response to it, is indeed to differ.</p>

<p>The principle which lay at the bottom of Newman’s renunciation
was one, however, which was equally familiar to
his friend. It may not always have involved, for him, the
need of so determined a depreciation of the loveliness of rural
England, as too keen a reminder of</p>

<p class="center small">‘Isaac’s pure blessings, and a verdant home,’</p>

<p class="unindent">things forsworn by both young men in that ‘highly religious
and romantic idea of celibacy’ which they had adopted for
good and all, between them, without Keble’s help. As Newman
says of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Basil and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Gregory, retiring together from
the world: ‘somehow, the idea of marrying-and-taking-Orders,
or taking-Orders-and-marrying; building or improving their
parsonages, and showing forth the charities, the humanities,
and the gentilities of a family man, did not suggest itself to
their minds.’ Nothing is plainer than that the arch-celibate
was Froude, and not Newman: perhaps it would be quite
exact to say that the idea, in Froude, as in Pascal, was
wholly endemic, and in Newman only so in part. We are
told in the <cite>Apologia</cite> how the idea was strengthened and
supernaturalised by contact with Froude. Hurrell sometimes
deplored with unmixed simplicity the social disqualifications
<!--093.png--><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pageno">67</span>
of a total abstainer. ‘I wrote S[am] a letter the other day,’
he tells Robert Wilberforce, when the future Bishop had
plighted his troth. ‘I suspect it was of the dullest! for I
have no knack at writing to people in his interesting situation.’
In all this lack of sympathy with ordinary conduct and
motive, there was no touch whatever of conscious oddity, but
only of childishness. Newman, by far the tenderer heart of
the two, never shared it.</p>

<p>Newman has left us an account of the origin of the sermon
he mentions, which was preached in the old Church on
July 16, 1831: that on the Pool of Bethesda, ‘Scripture a
Record of Human Sorrow,’ in the first volume of <cite>Parochial
Sermons</cite>. ‘Twice in my life,’ he writes about 1862, ‘have I,
when worn with work, gone to a friend’s house to recruit….
When I was down at Dartington for the first time, in July,
1831, I saw a number of young girls collected together,
blooming, and in high spirits; “and all went merry as a
marriage-bell.” And I sadly thought what changes were in
store, what hard trial and discipline was inevitable. I cannot
trace their history; but Phillis and Mary Froude married, and
died quickly. Hurrell died. One, if not two, of the young
Champernownes died.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_76" id="fnanchor_76"></a><a href="#footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></span> My sermon was dictated by the sight
and the foreboding. At that very visit [from Oxford] Hurrell
caught, and had his influenza upon him, which led him by slow
steps to the grave. He caught it sleeping, as I did, on deck,
going down the Channel from Southampton to Torbay.
Influenza was about, the forerunner of the cholera. It went
through the Parsonage at Dartington. Every morning the
sharp merry party, who somewhat quizzed me, had hopes it
would seize upon me. But I escaped; and sang my warning
from the pulpit…. I am a bird of ill omen.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_77" id="fnanchor_77"></a><a href="#footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Correspondence of course broke out anew, the moment the
two were parted. Hurrell’s Greek reading progressed on his
own summary lines. ‘<cite>Timæus</cite> gets worse and worse. I can see
no point in which it is interesting, except as a fact to prove
what stuff people have sucked down…. I have cut
<!--094.png--><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pageno">68</span>
<cite>Timæus</cite>,’ he announces a bit later, ‘and have nearly finished
<cite>Gorgias</cite>, which is as elegant and clever and easy as possible.’
His weather comments (such being unavoidable in England)
are concise and instructive. By way of letting Newman know
that there had been a fortnight of fine weather since the latter’s
own rainy experiences at Dartington, he throws out an abrupt
postscript of July 29: ‘What a lie old Swith.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_78" id="fnanchor_78"></a><a href="#footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></span> has told!’</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Thomas Mozley seems to have received conditional
offers or promises from Hurrell of sharing with him a
country cure. The former proposed first the vacant Moreton
Pinkney, thirty miles north of Oxford, then the parish of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Ebbe’s, within its ancient limits. But both projects failed of
realisation. Hurrell’s strength had to be hoarded, and Archdeacon
Froude was averse to any measure which would create
new duties, and cause a stricter separation between them. Keble,
on behalf of his friend, would have favoured Northamptonshire
rather than the city. He saw Newman on August 10 of this
Long Vacation of 1831. ‘He wishes you to have a country
parish,’ Newman writes; ‘he did not give his reasons.’
Newman himself coveted Hurrell’s parochial co-operation.
These plans for an active employment of superfluous energies,
formed, one after another, by appreciators of them, were
destined to be vain. Meanwhile, relish for historical study
was indicating to him how he could be of use, in a day
full of most unscholarly conceptions of the past, long
before the documentary firmament had been unrolled by
Government for the man in the street. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dandum est Deo eum
aliquid facere posse.</i> He knew the path he meant to take, and
communicates his dream to Newman, prefacing it with a bit
of encouraging domestic news: ‘W[illy] continues very steady,
getting up at half-past five, and working without wasting time
till two or three.’ His next surviving brother William was
then twenty years old, and reading for Honours.</p>

<p>‘Since you wish to have a definite categorical answer to
M[ozley’s] question, I will say, No; and having said this, will
<!--095.png--><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pageno">69</span>
proceed to my reasons and qualifications. First, whatever you
may think, I have a serious wish, and (if I could presume to
say so) intention of working at the ecclesiastical history of the
Middle Ages. Now, my father assures me that such a parish
as [<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Ebbe’s] would be a complete occupation of itself, so that
I am unwilling at once, and without giving myself the trial, to
give up the chance of doing what I cannot but think as clerical,
as improving, and much better suited to my capacity, such
as it is, than the care of a parish. A small parish, and a less
bothering one, might be a recreation, almost; but such an absorbing
one as this I should be sorry to take, till I found that I
could not work at anything else. Secondly, my qualification
of the ‘No’ is this: if you either feel very certain I shall do
nothing else, or have a strong opinion as to the improvement
I should get from the occupation you propose, believe me willing
to be convinced that my present view is incorrect.</p>

<p>‘I have read a good deal of Plato, have stuck in <cite>Parmenides</cite>
as in <cite>Timæus</cite>, but think all which keeps clear of metaphysics is
as beautiful and improving as anything I ever read. As to
Socrates, I can scarcely believe that he was not inspired, and
feel quite confident that Plato is responsible for every tint of
[puzzleheadedness] which shows itself in his arguments. One
is apt, of course, to be carried away with a thing at the moment;
but my present impression is, that <cite>Gorgias</cite>, <cite>Apologia Socratis</cite>,
<cite>Crito</cite>, and <cite>Phædo</cite>, rank next to the Bible in point of the greatness
of mind they show, and in grace of style and dramatic
beauty surpass anything I have ever read. I think I am
improved in composition, and attribute it to imitation of Plato.
I am going to serve D[enbury?] for the next month, and
shall have to write a number of sermons.</p>

<p>‘How atrociously the poor King of Holland<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_79" id="fnanchor_79"></a><a href="#footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></span> has been
used; but nothing yet is so painful as the defection of the
heads of the Church. I hear that the Bishop of Ferns<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_80" id="fnanchor_80"></a><a href="#footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></span> is
dying: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spes ultima</i>.’</p>

<p class="p2">During the early autumn, Froude returns to the curacy
<!--096.png--><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pageno">70</span>
question, and reiterates the conviction which his own idiosyncrasy
was strengthening in him every day, and which surely
was as warranted as it was sincere.</p>

<p>‘I have read the Lives of Wycliffe and Peacocke<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_81" id="fnanchor_81"></a><a href="#footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></span> in Strype;
but must read much more about them and their times, before I
shall understand them. At present I admire Peacocke and
dislike Wycliffe. A great deterioration seems to have taken
place in the spirit of the Church after Edward <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></span>’s death. I hope
I shall have perseverance to work up the history of the period.
If I do this, I shall not think myself bound to take a curacy.’</p>

<p>It is a thousand pities that we can never have on our
shelves the Froude of historical verity, to counterbalance
the Froude of historical romance. Hurrell, so far as he got,
was certainly all for ‘the ideas underlying history, and their
organic connection,’ and was but poorly adapted for ‘the insertion
of his own ideas into history … the professing to
find in history what he had in reality put there.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_82" id="fnanchor_82"></a><a href="#footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></span> Is it not
clear that such a fault may spring not from perverseness, but
from the too pictorial eye? This the elder brother lacked,
as likewise the other disadvantage of a magical prose style.
That perturbing possession, the luckiest asset of the essayist,
seems to delight in playing tricks on historians, for in the
past, at least, the dullest have been the safest.</p>

<p>As one who understood the dangers of style, Hurrell
chides Newman for the hair-splitting preliminary method to
which he was treating <cite>The Arians</cite>. ‘If you go on fiddling with
your Introduction, you will most certainly get into a scrape
at last!’ And then: ‘I have for the last five days been reading
Marsh’s <cite>Michaelis</cite>, which I took up by accident, and have
been much interested by it. I see that old Wilberforce<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_83" id="fnanchor_83"></a><a href="#footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></span> owes
to it much of the profundity which I have before now been
floored and overawed by. It has put many things into my
head that I never thought of before.’</p>

<p><!--097.png--><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pageno">71</span>
The first unmistakable symptoms of Hurrell’s chronic illness
had developed by the January of 1832. ‘I don’t think he
takes care of himself,’ Keble says anxiously, in a letter to
Newman, shortly after his election to the Professorship of
Poetry. And Hurrell himself had confessed to Newman, as it
were, ‘how ill all’s here about my heart: but ’tis no matter.’
Hence the reply from Oxford, on the 13th.</p>

<p>‘Your letter was most welcome, sad as it was; I call it
certainly, from beginning to end, a sad letter, and yet somehow
sad letters, in their place, and in God’s order, are as acceptable
as merry ones. What I write for now is to know why you will
not trust your brother to come up by himself? Let him go into
your rooms; and do stop in Devonshire a good while, in which
time you not only may get well, but may convince all about
you that you <em>are</em> well&mdash;an object not to be neglected….
Your advice about my work is not only sage, but good, yet
not quite applicable, though I shall bear it in mind. Recollect,
my good Sir, that every thought I think is thought, and every
word I write is writing, and that thought tells and that words
take room, and that though I make the Introduction the whole
book, yet a book it is; and though this will not steer clear of
the egg blunder, to have an Introduction leading to nothing,
yet it is not losing time. Already I have made forty-one
pages out of eighteen.’ The correspondence between the two,
then as ever, gives diverting glimpses of the mordant and
ineffably frank critic away from Oxford, and the divine and
man-of-letters in residence who continually sought, ‘in the
beaten way of friendship,’ the advice he did not invariably
need. Thus he sends a rough draft to Dartington of ‘a
sermon against Sir James Mackintosh, Knight,’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_84" id="fnanchor_84"></a><a href="#footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></span> expecting
strictures, ‘should you discern anything heretical,’ and calling
special attention to the argument: ‘therefore be sharp.’ The
young censor was pleased to approve ‘on the whole,’ though
with minor reservations. ‘As to your <cite>Annotationes in
Neandri<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_85" id="fnanchor_85"></a><a href="#footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></span> Homiliam</cite>,’ Newman writes cheerfully, ‘to be sure
I have treated them with what is now called true respect; for
<!--098.png--><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pageno">72</span>
I have spoken highly of them, and done everything but use
them! I did not have them till Saturday morning; so having
your authority for what I wanted (<i>i.e.</i>, the soundness of the
main position and the <ins title="topoi">τόποι</ins>), I became indolent.’</p>

<p>Meanwhile, towards the end of January, Hurrell sends an
asked-for bulletin of his physical progress, and follows it up
with several others, in all of which he makes it unconsciously
plain that he has more pressing interests than his own sinking
barometry. His mind was going forward by leaps and bounds
towards convictions then unguessed-at, now quite general,
about ‘the Tudor Settlement.’</p>

<p class="p2 center">To the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <span class="smcap">J. H. Newman</span>, <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 29, 1832.</p>

<p>‘I promised I would give an account of myself, if I did
not appear in person by the beginning of Term. I am getting
rid, though by slow degrees, of all vestiges of cough, and, what
is more to the purpose, my father is quite easy about me, which
he was far from being when I first came home…. I have been
very idle lately, but have taken up Strype now and then, and
have not increased my admiration of the Reformers. One
must not speak lightly of a martyr, so I do not allow my
opinions to pass the verge of scepticism. But I really do feel
sceptical whether Latimer was not something in the Bulteel<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_86" id="fnanchor_86"></a><a href="#footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></span>
line; whether the Catholicism of their formulæ was not a concession
to the feelings of the nation, with whom Puritanism had
not yet become popular, and who could scarcely bear the
alterations which were made; and whether the progress of
things in Edward the Sixth’s minority may not be considered
as the jobbing of a faction. I will do myself the justice to say
that those doubts give me pain, and that I hope more reading
will in some degree dispel them. As far as I have gone, too,
<!--099.png--><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pageno">73</span>
I think better than I was prepared to do of Bonner and
Gardiner. Certainly the <ins title="êthos">ἦθος</ins> of the Reformation is to me a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra incognita</i>, and I do not think that it has been explored
by anyone that I have heard talk about it.’</p>

<p>With what astonishing prescience this novice surveys his
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra incognita</i>!</p>

<p class="p2">Again, writing to Newman on <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 17, the obsession for
historical truth, as the handmaid to religious reform, breaks
through some melancholy detail. He has been asked for a
full bulletin; he confesses that the doctor states, and that he
himself cannot deny, that there has been an attack on the
lungs, attended, however, with but little pain or fever. He
finds it ‘disheartening,’ for he had been taking long rides, and
was in great spirits. Then he runs on to a topic which occurs
to him not for the first nor for the last time. Might it not be a
good thing to turn journalist, to have a Quarterly, and to speak
in it the thing which is? ‘Imagine me in a yellow jacket,’ he
says elsewhere to Newman; imagine him seated, and goose-quilled,
and editorial. It was never to be. Was it not quite
as well? Would not Mr. Froude (if the pun will pass muster)
have proved gunpowder in a Magazine? He talks as he
always talks of his own inspirations, derisively. But plainly,
his heart is in it. He would start, this time, ‘on a very unpretending
scale,’ and design his foxy Quarterly ‘to be at first only
historical and matter-of-fact, so that writing for it would be the
reverse of a waste of time even if it failed entirely, which I
really hardly think possible, considering the ridiculous unfounded
notions most people have got, and the vast quantity
of unexplored ground. A thing of that sort might sneak into
circulation as a book of antiquarian research, and yet, if well-managed,
might undermine many prejudices. I am willing to
think that I could contribute two articles per annum to such a
work, without losing a moment of time, indeed getting through
more than I should else. Memoirs of Hampden would be a
subject [Keble] would take to with zest, as he hates that worthy
with as much zeal and more knowledge than your humble
servant. However, this is a scheme formed at a distance,
which, as Johnson remarks, makes rivers look narrow and
<!--100.png--><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pageno">74</span>
precipices smooth. Can you tell me where to go for the
history of Lutheranism? I must know something of it, before
I get a clue to Cranmer and the rest.’</p>

<p class="p2">Lastly, to the same correspondent, on <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 26.</p>

<p>‘… I trouble you with a few lines of grateful acknowledgment
for the concern you are so kind as to take in my
welfare, though I cannot at the same time refrain from
observing that your advice does more credit to your heart than
your head…. I was at Dr. [Yonge’s<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_87" id="fnanchor_87"></a><a href="#footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></span>], where I stayed three
days, and was thoroughly examined. He assures me that whatever
may have been the matter with me, I am now thoroughly
well, and that I may return to Oxford at once without imprudence.
At the same time, he says I must be extremely
cautious, as the thing which formed in my windpipe proves me
to be very liable to attack, and he looks on it as an extraordinary
piece of luck that I got rid of it as I did. I am
to wear more clothing than I have hitherto done, and to
renounce wine for ever; the prohibition extends to beer: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quò
confugiam</i>?’</p>

<p class="p2">Before Hurrell left home, his father had notified Newman
of their conditional intention to visit the Continent. ‘If the
doctor advises it,’ the Archdeacon writes on <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 22, ‘I have
offered to be Hurrell’s companion to the Mediterranean, or
any other part of the world that may be supposed most favourable
in such a case as his. I own [that] my faith in the advantages
to be gained by going abroad is not very great, unless
they can be procured under the most favourable circumstances.
At any rate, I think your suggestion for his giving up the office
of Treasurer<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_88" id="fnanchor_88"></a><a href="#footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></span> shall be followed.’ He had held this office of
Junior Treasurer since 1828, to the great general satisfaction,
sharing with Newman the mental quickness, the ‘constitutional
accuracy’ and the conscientiousness which go towards the casting-up
of a perfect accountant. Hurrell, however, came up in
the spring, whence he blithely reports his improved health.</p>

To the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <span class="smcap">John Keble</span>, May 5, 1832.</p>

<p>‘… Thinking that you may wish to know something of
my concerns, and wishing to know something of yours, … I
send you the following. As to myself, about which valuable
thing I am most concerned, you must know that I have at last
found a <ins title="krêsphygeton">κρησφύγετον</ins> in barley-sugar; only to think that my stars
should let me off so easily! Sucking has had a most wonderful
effect on me, and has removed nearly all that F[airford]<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_89" id="fnanchor_89"></a><a href="#footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></span> had
left of tendency to irritation; I might say all, if I could suck
continually, but just now these east winds take advantage of
casual intervals, and remind me that I am not perfectly at
liberty. However, I have left off my handkerchief, and never
feel the want of it; also, I am up at half-past six every
morning; and taking an enlarged view of myself, I think my
condition to be approved of.’</p>

<p class="p2">Up to July 31, Froude remained in Oxford, being and
doing with all his usual zest, writing his papers on architecture,
proving a very well-head of vitality to his friends, and ‘living
his life.’ Could it have been indeed as early as this that he
cut across the preliminaries described by Lord Blachford,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_90" id="fnanchor_90"></a><a href="#footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></span>
and paralysed an intended appeal to Bishops and Deans by
announcing that he, for one, meant to ‘get on the box’ in
person? This is thought to be the moment of Miss Giberne’s
inspiration. It would seem as if the date should be a year
later. In July of 1832 the Tutorial question was over; and
there was no other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agendum</i> in debate between Froude and
Newman. However that may be, there in the handsome lady’s
sketch-book is Hurrell, smoothly, almost infantinely, mischievous,
with one obedient Mozley to listen and abet; there
is Newman, at an angle of the ottoman, distinctly not
surveying with fond adoring gaze and yearning heart his
friend (as he says he does, in a poem, part of which, at least,
was written that very week), but back to back with him, sulking
furiously, and putting on a silent stare which sufficiently
expresses human disapproval: that little sudden void stare,
<!--104.png--><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pageno">76</span>
entirely characteristic, as of one who is forced to survey, for
the time being, an endless vista of Siberian snows.</p>

<p>It was a boding time; the cholera was raging all about;
Newman himself was tired and dejected from overwork, and
none too hopeful concerning Hurrell’s health or the impending
prospect of separation. Long after, annotating his own correspondence
at Edgbaston, he tells us something special about
the lines just referred to, in what may be called, from a merely
literary point of view, one of the most successful, though one
of the least known, of his shorter lyrics. Hurrell’s share in it
is no more, so to speak, than a tiny marginal portrait of him,
tender, in passing, as the work of some old Flemish illuminator.
Newman ascribes the origin of the last lines to this July.
‘With reference to the memory of that parting, when I shook
hands with him, and looked into his face with great affection,
I afterwards wrote the stanza:</p>

<div class="poem-container no-break">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0a">‘And when thine eye surveys</div>
  <div class="i0">With fond adoring gaze</div>

  <div class="i0">Love to its grave doth tend.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_91" id="fnanchor_91"></a><a href="#footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></span></div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>But it is remarkable that the completed poem is dated
Valetta, January 30, 1833: as if to mark the vanishing of
the only shadow which ever crossed the united path of
Newman and Froude; and that shadow was due, as we shall
see, to a fancy of Newman’s, conceived in illness. Abstract and
gnomic as his verses are, two human faces, nameless but
recognisable, look through them with ‘sad eyes spiritual and
clear.’ One is Mary Newman’s, in her sisterly youth;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_92" id="fnanchor_92"></a><a href="#footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></span> the
other is Hurrell Froude’s. Dearly as Newman loved his many
friends, then and after (and as Dean Church reminds us,
mutual affection as profound as that of the early Christians,
was the very hall-mark of the Tractarians), there is but one friend
discernible in the long vista of his poetry, most of which was
written in his living presence. Hurrell may never have
suspected as much. The temper of both, shrinking from the
<!--105.png--><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pageno">77</span>
least emotional emphasis, would have precluded any open
give-and-take. The privilege of being English has its own
system of taxation. The Cardinal, in his old age (possibly
when <cite>Little Lord Fauntleroy</cite> was overrunning the stage), had to
assure some inquirer, by post, that he hardly had been in the
habit of addressing Hurrell as ‘Dearest,’ in the prose exigences
of every day.</p>

<p>The truant Fellow, restored to his father’s Parsonage, was
able to send a definite announcement of his future movements,
within a fortnight of his leaving Oxford.</p>

<p>‘I am afraid poor [Willy] will make no hand of his Second
Class. He has no interest, and can pick up none, for what he
is about; and all his interleaves and margins are scribbled over
with lug sails. You will be glad to hear that I have made up
my mind to spend the winter in the Mediterranean, and my
father is going with me, the end of November, and we shall
see Sicily and the south of Italy. We are both very anxious
that you should come with us. I think it would set you up….
I have read M. Thierry’s stuff.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_93" id="fnanchor_93"></a><a href="#footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></span> His ignorance is surprising.
He supposes Oxford to have been a Bishopric in Henry the
Second’s time, and he sticks in Saxons <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</i>, quoting
authorities with which I am familiar, and where nothing of the
sort occurs. My translations have been at a standstill….
Also, I am getting to be a sawney,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_94" id="fnanchor_94"></a><a href="#footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></span> and not to relish the
dreary prospects which you and I have proposed to ourselves.
But this is only a feeling: depend on it, I will not shrink, if I
buy my constancy at the expense of a permanent separation
from home. I think this journey will set me up, and then I
shall try my new style of preaching. We must indulge ourselves
and other people with a little excitement on such
matters, or else the indifferentists will run away with everything!’</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="p2">William Froude, at Michaelmas, took his First Class in
<!--106.png--><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><span class="pageno">78</span>
Mathematics, and a Third in Classics, quite as Hurrell expected.
As to the microbe of travel thus featly introduced into the
post, it did its work upon the recipient, though not without
much hesitation and debate. One of Newman’s arguments
against a plan with which, it is plain, he fell violently in love
at once, was the state of his own health, involving, possibly,
some additional responsibility for Archdeacon Froude. ‘You
need fear nothing,’ Hurrell gallantly assures him, ‘on the
score of two invalids: I am certainly better now than I have
been for more than a year. I bathed yesterday with great
advantage, took a very long walk, drank five glasses of wine,
and am better for it all. My contemplated expedition is
wholly preventative, so don’t be uneasy on that score…. As
to my sawney feelings, I own that home does make me a
sawney, and that the First Eclogue runs in my head absurdly.
But there is more in the prospect of becoming an ecclesiastical
agitator than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">At nos hinc alii</i>, etc.’</p>

<p class="p2">On Monday, December 3, Newman set out on the Southampton
coach, reaching Exeter next day, and Falmouth, whence
the Maltese packet of 800 tons, called the <span class="shipname">Hermes</span>, was to
sail, early on the Wednesday morning following. He wrote
there his poem,</p>

<p class="center small">‘Are these the tracks of some unearthly friend?’</p>

<p class="unindent">the first of eighty-five dating from the Mediterranean voyage,
the eighty-fifth being the ‘Lead, Kindly Light’ which has
endeared to English-speaking pilgrims the Straits of Bonifacio.
When the Froudes arrived at Falmouth, Newman had a
nocturnal adventure to relate to them. He had been very
roundly sworn at by a person, apparently a gentleman, who
sat near him on the box. ‘I had opened by telling him he
was talking great nonsense to a silly goose of a maid-servant
stuck atop of the coach; so I had no reason to complain!’
The hasty fellow-traveller afterwards apologised. In the moonlight
he had attributed a highly laic motive to Newman’s
interference, so the latter explains to his mother. On the
8th of December the <span class="shipname">Hermes</span> sailed. The three friends were
to be together for five months, and their route is minutely
<!--107.png--><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><span class="pageno">79</span>
and enchantingly mapped out in the first volume of the
Newman <cite>Correspondence</cite>. The journey held unique experiences,
filled with interest, for the two younger men, and they,
on their part, seemed to have interested deeply many whom
they met. Hurrell kept a log as they moved, for his brothers
and sisters, for Mr. Keble, for Mr. Williams, and a few others;
and out of it a fairly connected narrative can be extracted,
of a colour and form quite other than Newman’s, the better
correspondent, but graphic enough. Before starting on his
voyage, Hurrell had seen in print, in the first and second
volumes of <cite>The British Magazine</cite>, both his pioneer papers on
Gothic Architecture, and the earlier chapters of his history of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas à Becket; these were followed, in volume iv., by
The Project of Henry <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></span> for Uniting Church and State, <span class="muchsmaller">A.D.</span>
1154.</p>

<p class="p2 center">To the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <span class="smcap">John Keble</span>, <abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 12, 1832.</p>

<p>‘We started from Falmouth about eleven, on the 8th.
“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jamque tibi e mediis pelagi</i> mirabilis <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">undis</i>,” about sixty-eight
miles to the south of Oporto, and thirty from the shore: the
sea a perfect sheet of glass, showing the reflection of the stars,
particularly Sirius, which is most splendid. The Pole-star
sinking perceptibly: I am sure the Great Bear’s tail must have
had a dip as he went his rounds. It has been very calm all
day, and we have gone seven-and-a-half miles an hour: when
the sun came to the meridian our latitude was 41° 36´. In
the daytime the sea was a pale blue colour; I will not attempt
to describe the sunset. Yesterday was very interesting: when
we came on deck in the morning we could just make out Cape
Ortegal to the south-east of us, at a distance of about forty
miles. It was very pale, and scarcely to be distinguished from
the sky, but rose very high above the horizon, and, as we
neared it, seemed to be quite precipitous; we did not get
within thirty miles, so that it has left on my mind only the
ghost of an impression: but it is a grand ghost. We saw
where Corunna lay, and must have been within twenty miles
of some part of the coast between that and Cape Finisterre,
which we doubled in the dark. All of it was of a very
singular character, but insignificant compared with Cape
<!--108.png--><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pageno">80</span>
Ortegal. All that day the wind was fresh from the east, and
the sea very wild and grand, of a deep black-blue, covered
with breakers: we went rather more than eight miles an hour,
though the ship tossed amazingly. This was the first day
that we had had a clear sky, and marvellous it was: a strong
east wind in the middle of December, and the climate like
May! our latitude at noon 44° 3´. There is something in the
colour of the sea out of soundings, which is very striking to
one who has only seen the shallow water that surrounds
England. There is not a tint of green in it; to-day it has
been a pale blue, like a beautiful lake; yesterday it was a
black-purple. We find that this steamer is to touch at Cadiz
and Algiers, and to spend two days at Gibraltar, in the way to
Malta, and that afterwards it is to spend four days between
Zante, Cephalonia, Ithaca, and Leucadia, touching at Patras
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">olim</i> Patræ), then to spend six at Corfu, and afterwards return
to Malta the same way; so we shall certainly extend our trip.
The commander and the midshipmen are a very gentlemanlike
set, and we the only passengers: so it is most luxurious….
And now I am stupid; if there is nothing more to tell to-morrow,
I shall fill up the blank between Falmouth and Cape
Ortegal, which may be regarded as our Dark Age.</p>

<p>‘<span class="date">Thursday evening.</span>&mdash;The day has again been beautiful, and
quite summery, with scarcely a cloud. When the sun rose we
were off the Berlingas (some small sharp rocks, which you will
see in a map), and from thence we kept near shore all the way
to the rock of Lisbon. The greater part of the way we could
not have been much more than a mile off. The sea has been
its old green to-day; the coast all along very peculiar, not very
high, but wild, and strongly marked; the rock precipitous, and
deeply indented, and every promontory relieved by a thin mist
of spray from the breakers of the Atlantic. We watched them
curl in upon the shore, each rising in a green transparent line
as it came to its turn to break, and then turning partially into
a delicate mist where it met the more prominent rocks, till at
last the whole line seemed to burst, and another rose behind its
aërified relics, and put me in mind of <ins title="Aphroditê">Ἀφροδίτη</ins>…. When we
passed Mafra we saw the cupolas of the palace of Cintra, and,
through an opening of the hills, made out the greater part of
<!--109.png--><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pageno">81</span>
it through glasses. The situation is strange for so magnificent
a building. And now we had a clear view of the ridge on
which the Duke took up his position on the northern side of
the lines of Torres Vedras. I will not attempt to describe it,
except that it is grand to a degree, rising in spire-like shaggy
tops, and cut by deep ravines, the sides of which were fringed
with what we were told were cork trees. As we got near we
saw many villas about half-way up, and on the two highest
points were two convents. The Roman Catholics are queer
fellows: they are determined to be admired and not envied;
we, unhappily <ins title="lachontes antistrophon tychên">λαχόντες ἀντιοστρόφον τυχὴν</ins>, are envied and not
admired. We doubled Capo Roca at three, and then went
down to dinner. The mouth of the Tagus was too distant to
make anything out, except the masts of the English ships, who
are there to bully Don Miguel.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_95" id="fnanchor_95"></a><a href="#footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></span> On Friday we got up at seven
to see Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Vincent, and passed close under it. The light
on it was very fine, and the form of the rocks bold; but
yesterday had spoiled us. The day is fine, cloudless, and
windless&mdash;almost too hot…. Just now we saw a fishing-boat,
and made towards it. The people were in a great fright, and
pulled with all their might, while they thought there was a
chance to get away; at last they gave up in despair. When
we came up we found they had no fish: there were four of
them, very dark complexions, and, as well as I could judge,
Moorish features: the boat, sails, and all, perfectly un-English
(a word which has ceased to be vituperative in my vocabulary).
The coast which we are now passing is too distant to be very
interesting, but a grey ridge of mountains rises behind, out of
a dead flat, reminding one that we are off a strange land.
The lateen sails, too, of which many are about, and two turtles
which we almost ran over just now, and a shark’s fin just
showing above water, all tell the same story…. On Sunday
morning it was foggy and disagreeable, and we were in the
dreaded Bay of Biscay: however, I was still well enough to do
Service on board…. All the ship’s crew attended except
the steersman and the stokers, <i>i.e.</i>, the fellows that feed the
fire of the engine. The commander had them all upon deck
<!--110.png--><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pageno">82</span>
in the morning and gave them a practical discourse on good
behaviour, which amused [Newman] and me by being so much
to the point: he is a nice fellow, I think. After Service I was
fairly done up, and lost my character…. Next day we were
in the middle of the Bay: still cloudy and damp, and a long
gentle swell: but we had served our time, and were all alive and
merry…. In the evening we found that the commander was
a musician and a painter; he had a very elegant miniature of
his wife that he had finished up for his amusement at sea; and
he sang us several songs, accompanying himself on the Spanish
guitar, in very good taste, as [Newman] said: we the <ins title="amyêtoi">ἀμύητοι</ins>
liked it much; and we have not had any qualms since: and
now I have got on to where the rest begins. We live
splendidly on board, have a cabin each, capital dinners, and
good company: the three midshipmen, gentlemanlike obliging
fellows as can be: yesterday they went out of the vessel’s
course, to show us the coast to advantage.</p>

<p>‘<span class="date">Saturday.</span>&mdash;On getting up, found ourselves in Cadiz
harbour; the convent bells put us in mind that we are in a
religious country: it sounded just like Oxford before Morning
Chapel. We found ourselves in quarantine and unable to land.
The Consul’s boat came off for the letters, rowed by eight
Spaniards, such odd-looking fellows! they row without
rullocks, having a strap and a <ins title="tropôtêr">τροπωτήρ</ins>…. We saw the
unfinished Cathedral very distinctly through a glass: it had
not at all an ecclesiastical look, but was large and picturesque.
It will never be finished now, I suppose, as the day of apostasy
seems at hand in Spain.</p>

<p>‘<span class="date">Sunday morning.</span>&mdash;Here we are at Gibraltar.’</p>

<p class="p2">Newman’s letters, enthusiastic over sky and sea, are full of
the horrors of the ship (which he says was not properly cleaned
before being sent down from Woolwich), and of the little stuffy
rooms which are enough to kill a valetudinarian; but valetudinarian
Hurrell seems to have enjoyed it all.</p>

<p class="p2 center">To the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Isaac Williams</span>, <abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 27, 1832.</p>

<p>‘… We were at Gibraltar only forty-eight hours, and of
that we were in quarantine forty. The remaining eight hours,
<!--111.png--><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="pageno">83</span>
however, we turned to account, under the auspices of the
Colonel of engineers, who was kind enough to lend us horses,
and go over everything with us: unfortunately we were there
so short a time, that we could only see what was curious, and
had no leisure for the picturesque; to enjoy which, it would
have been necessary to ride away five or six miles, on what
they call the neutral ground: the low sandy isthmus which
joins the rock to the continent; but from the fortifications we
saw enough to convince us what a magnificent object it must
be. In our scramble we had the luck to see three or four
monkeys, scrambling, with the greatest ease, up and down
what seemed a smooth precipice. I know how odious descriptions
are, yet I must just tell you that, among other things,
we were taken through a gallery cut out in the most precipitous
face of the rock, about 650 feet above the base, and
800 feet below the top, so that when you peep out through
the port-holes, which are cut every here and there for cannon,
you seem suspended in mid-air, and feel giddy, in whatever
direction you look. Thanks to Colonel R[ogers] we saw so
much that we had no right to grumble at the quarantine:
but it really is something so exquisitely grotesque, that one
cannot help being provoked. We were moored close alongside
of a coal-wharf, and all the day that we were imprisoned,
a parcel of fellows of the town were at work, wheeling coals
into our vessel, and upsetting them on the deck, so that they
were in all but contact with our crew for a whole day; also,
all packages were received, after undergoing the ceremony of
a partial ducking in the water; and letters had a chisel dug
into them, which was supposed to let out the cholera. And
while all this absurd farce was going on, we were imprisoned
in one of the most interesting places in the world, not knowing
when we should be released, or whether at all; however, even
in this time, we had some amusement from the variety of
curious figures that came down to the Quay to look at us.
One fellow, a Moorish Jew, was dressed so picturesquely, and
looked so exotic altogether, that I tried to draw him; but
he saw what I was at, and first hallooed out: “You no paint
me,” and, when I went on, he bolted as fast as he could. The
Moors are magnificent-looking fellows, with very high stern
<!--112.png--><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pageno">84</span>
features, dark eyes, and very marked nostrils that give to the
full face rather a look of ferocity; even the lowest of them
look like aristocrats. The Spanish women, too, were worth
looking at: three of them came down to visit a merchant who
came with us from Cadiz; the high head-dresses were the only
peculiarity in their dress, but one of them was very fine-looking,
and very unlike an Englishwoman. I should have thought
her ladylike, only she spat with the most perfect indifference,
just as &mdash;&mdash; would in C[ommon] R[oom]. We left Gibraltar at
ten on Monday night, and had very calm beautiful weather
for two days…. We got to Algiers [Thursday morning] about
three, and it was then rough, cloudy, and blowing fresh. This
is the most wretched, wicked-looking place I ever set eyes
upon. I can associate its idea with nothing but a wasp’s nest.
It is huddled together, leaving no apparent room for its streets;
its windows are loop-holes, as if to fire through. All beyond
its walls looks perfectly desolate, except a number of white
specks, which are houses where the rich inhabitants retire in
time of plague. The town itself is a mass of white, as
perfectly white as a chalk quarry; and the monotony of the
glare<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_96" id="fnanchor_96"></a><a href="#footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></span> is only relieved by the rust of weather-stains, which are
not white-washed by the French so regularly as by the Moors.</p>

<p>‘The Quay, as every one knows, is a strong battery,
expressly for the shelter of pirates; and, when one thought
of the horrors that had been practised in that detestable place,
and felt the personal discomfort of an approaching storm, and
saw, for a foreground, the infamous tricoloured flag on the
ships, the general impression was as much the reverse of
favourable as can easily be fancied. A boat came alongside
with the Vice-consul, for letters. His Excellency was an
English Jew, and there was an half-starved Frenchman for
his <ins title="paredros">πάρεδρος</ins>. He was rowed by four fellows, of what race
I know not…. Their features were perfect apathy, and looked
like stuffed red leather more than flesh and blood. If we had
touched any one of the crew we should have been in for a
hundred days’ quarantine in every port of Europe, and yet the
wretches had the impudence to insist on our slitting all the
letters, to let out the cholera. We stayed an hour, and then
<!--113.png--><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pageno">85</span>
started; and sure enough, the storm came. The wind was
north-west, and blew right across from the Gulf of Lyons,
which I shall always think more formidable than the Bay of
Biscay. The wind lasted till we got under the lee of Sardinia;
and what with the stink of the bilge-water, which was stirred
up by the tossing, and the constant noise, and the difficulty
of standing and sitting and eating and drinking, we were
constantly wretched enough. My father spent the whole
time in his berth; [Newman] and I the greater part of ours.
But ills have their end. The sea and the stink subsided, and
we made the rest of our voyage to Malta stilly and quickly,
arriving there on Monday morning after breakfast. [Newman]
does not think his health perceptibly improved yet,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_97" id="fnanchor_97"></a><a href="#footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></span> but he
has entirely got over sea-sickness, and has written an immense
deal for the <cite>Lyra Apostolica</cite>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_98" id="fnanchor_98"></a><a href="#footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></span> He has written so many letters
to his mother and sisters, that I need say no more about him.
He will write to you soon. I know you will think this a very
dull letter, as it is about places and not people; but we have
been so little on shore, that I have not been able to indulge
your taste. Kindest remembrances to O.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_99" id="fnanchor_99"></a><a href="#footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></span> I will write to
him soon.&mdash;Yours affectionately,</p>

<p class="sigright">R. H. F.’</p>

<p class="p2">From Malta also, on Christmas night, a letter was
despatched to Dartington, addressed, apparently, to John
Spedding Froude, which carries on the record of the travellers.
All the Froudes, like all the Hares, could draw.</p>

<p class="p2">‘… There is so much that is picturesque and singular
about this place, that I do not despair of occupation for all the
<!--114.png--><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pageno">86</span>
fifteen days in drawing, if the weather is only tolerable. The
boats, and the dresses, and the colours and forms of the buildings
are all as good practice as anything I can fancy, and I shall not
be sorry to have time on my hands for studying them at leisure.
We shall be allowed to go about the harbour [in quarantine]
as much as we like, and there are several places where we
may land. This will have to start a day or two after our
return, so you will not hear much more of Malta till the next
packet. As yet I have made egregious failures in attempts
to colour; indeed, I have had no opportunity of doing anything
from nature, and recollection supplies one too indistinctly.
My father has made many very interesting coast drawings as
we have come along, but he has done nothing in a finished way.</p>

<p>‘<span class="date">Corfu, <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 1.</span>&mdash;We got here the day before yesterday,
after a most interesting voyage. The sea has been as still
as a lake, and we have had a light breeze in our favour;
but it must be owned that we have sailed away from the
fine weather. Ever since we got here it has rained torrents,
and is now blowing a violent gale, so that we thank our
stars we are in harbour. On Friday morning we (as you
would say) made Zante on our larboard bow, at a distance
of about fifty miles. The high land of Cephalonia appeared
at the same time, so they kept her away three-quarters of a
point, and made for the passage between the islands. The
south point of Cephalonia is a very high mountain; it was
covered with snow, which here and there appeared through
the clouds. Zante is cliffy, and not so very unlike some of
the Isle of Wight.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_100" id="fnanchor_100"></a><a href="#footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></span> We got to the town just after dark,
and went ashore to make out what we could. We went to
a billiard-room, a coffee-house, the head inn, and two or
three shops. Everything was filthy to a degree, but there
seemed to be some really handsome houses, such as Sir
John Vanbrugh might have built. The shops are all open
to the street, and one would think that the shopkeepers
had never taken more than coppers in their lives; yet in a
tobacco shop, on asking the price of a cherry-stick pipe,
which I should have guessed at twelve shillings in England,
they told me it was one hundred dollars, and a midshipman
<!--115.png--><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pageno">87</span>
who was with us, and had lived a great deal in those parts,
said that it was not at all dear at the money. The mouthpiece
was amber inlaid with turquoise, and in that miserable-looking
shop there must have been thirty or forty more
pipes as costly: I wonder where they get customers? We
drank a bottle of Zante wine at the head inn, and very
nice it was; on asking the price, the landlord most unaffectedly
said there was nothing to pay, and when we gave
him a shilling he seemed to think it was most munificent.</p>

<p>‘… The town is now in possession of a Suliote chief, who
has taken the castle into his own hands, and has quartered
himself and his followers in all the best houses of the town,
which is now newly building, and promises to be regular,
and even elegant. The streets are quite straight, and cut
one another at right angles, and the houses all have piazzas
before them; but everything is now at a standstill, and
the streets themselves, unpaved, are more like the courses
of rivulets than anything else. It was a night of rejoicing,
this being the Day of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dionysius, and all the common
people were assembled in the bazaar, a sort of shambles,
and the gentlemen in a coffee-room, smoking and playing
cards, in their best dresses: most of them were fine-looking
fellows, very quiet and polite. We had coffee there, and
very capital it was, but thick and almost like chocolate. I
should like to know how they make it. The Greeks there
were all dressed in their white linen petticoats, embroidered
coats, and shaggy capotes, except one old fellow, who had
on an English box-coat, and one other fellow, whom, from
his vulgar impudent countenance, I conclude to have been
an English blackguard. They all say the Morea is in a
most wretched state, full of banditti and pirates, so that
you cannot go anywhere without an escort. Next day we
found ourselves just off Ithaca, at breakfast-time, and got
breakfast over before we entered the strait between Ithaca
and Cephalonia. This was the first day that I attempted
what is called sketching, and I made a tolerable hand of it;
at least, I found out how to make memoranda that did to
work upon afterwards. I can make no hand of colour, and
think I shall hardly attempt it, till I have time to make
<!--116.png--><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pageno">88</span>
some finished studies from nature. You and W[illy] care so
little about classics, that I need not trouble you about
Ulysses’ castle, Sappho’s leap, etc. We got here on Sunday
night, and the rain came soon after us, and has persecuted
us incessantly ever since. We got ashore yesterday and
walked about the town, which is very picturesque, and
exactly like the panorama….</p>

<p>‘We were at a ball at Corfu on the anniversary of the
installation of the Ionian Government, at which all the
native population were expected; but the day was so
stormy that it made a poor show. I meant to have got
you a real Albanian capote, but they were not to be had
at Corfu, and the cherry-stick tobacco-pipes were too
dear.’</p>

<p class="p2 center">To the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Isaac Williams</span>, <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 10, 1833.</p>

<p>‘We spent Christmas Day at Malta in an incessant row,
taking in coals, while the bells of all the many Churches of
Valetta told what was going on in that land of superstition;&mdash;watched
one poor fellow in quarantine all day, saying prayers
to himself, and looking towards the Church nearest on the
shore, opposite to the Lazaretto.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_101" id="fnanchor_101"></a><a href="#footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></span> The time is now drawing
nigh when we shall spend fifteen long days in that abode of
the unblessed. It is now the 10th of January, and we are
just in sight of Malta, on our return from the Ionian
Islands. We have not seen them under the most favourable
circumstances, as the weather has been wintry, <i>i.e.</i>, either
very stormy or very cold. I have been often longing for
the bright hot Spanish sun which conducted us from the
Bay of Biscay to Gibraltar…. Among other things, we
spent half an hour in the coffee-house [at Zante] where the
Greek merchants were assembled for the holiday evening:
a little wretched dirty place, but the company were very
<!--117.png--><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pageno">89</span>
polite to us, and we were surprised at the cleanness of their
dresses, and a certain refinement in their appearance and
manner. We were under the guidance of Major L[ongley]
brother of L[ongley] of H[arrow]<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_102" id="fnanchor_102"></a><a href="#footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></span> who is Governor of Cythera,
and knows something of the habits and language of the
people. The company all rose to him, and sat down when
he said <ins title="katheste">κάθεστε</ins>; but they pronounce so queerly, that one
can hardly ever make out a word, although their newspapers
are quite intelligible, and differ but little from old Greek.
I would give much to live among them for a bit, and get
into their notions. As it is, we have seen nothing but the
surface, and heard the notions of the resident English, which
cannot be relied on…. In Corfu, the breed is very
mongrel, mixed up with Venetian and Italian blood; so
that, altogether, the sight was uninteresting, except that
when one saw a splendid set of apartments, with magnificent
English furniture, and brilliantly illuminated, with a band of
music, etc., it contrasted itself oddly with the thought of old
Thucydides and the Corcyrean sedition. The remains of
the old town are very scanty, and one cannot make out
anything satisfactory about <ins title="to Hêraion">τὸ Ἡραῖον</ins>, etc. There is a
rock that they call Ulysses’ ship; but I suspect the name
of a Venetian origin. In one place there is the remains of
an Ionic temple, on a very small scale, lately discovered;
but we had no time to go into antiquarian questions.
We rode over most of the island, and saw several of the
villages, all of which bear marks of having been tenanted by
a rich population; but everything is of a Venetian character.
I cannot make out whether the people are religious or not;
yet they seem, on the whole, to be an innocent civil set.
Every small knot of families have their priest and their
chapel, but no parishes that we could hear of. Their Churches
are very small, but great numbers of them: two or three to
a small village. [Newman] and my father went into one in
an out-of-the-way village, in which there [were] fine silver
lamps, a copy of Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper, well
<!--118.png--><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pageno">90</span>
executed, and several pictures of Saints, in the hard German
style of the fifteenth century. I went twice into the Church
which is the depository of the body of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Spiridion;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_103" id="fnanchor_103"></a><a href="#footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></span> and
people were praying there both times, one person apparently
from the higher classes. In the chapel where the body lies,
lamps are always kept dimly burning, and the people go in
and kiss the shrine. The feet are stained with tears, and
there are many splendid offerings there of precious stones.
They keep all the Saints’ days by going to Church, and
playing cards afterwards; and on the fast days they fast
fairly…. On our way back from Corfu, the curtain was
drawn back which had before hung over the scenery, and the
long ridges of the Acarnanian mountains appeared in full
splendour; among these many points in the range of Pindus
were visible in the distance; and from Zante we certainly
saw the summit of Parnassus, though partially intercepted
with clouds. To look at, Mount <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Meri, in the north of
Morea, is the most magnificent, but I do not know its
classical name.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_104" id="fnanchor_104"></a><a href="#footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></span> And now I suppose I must bid farewell to
these extraordinary places for the rest of my life; having
only just seen enough of them to know how well worth
seeing they are.’</p>

<p class="p2">The fifteen days of detention were not quite so annoying
or so monotonous as the travellers had feared. ‘This Lazaret,’
says Newman in the course of a long letter to his sister Jemima,
‘was built by the Knights [of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John at Malta] for the Turks….
We burn olive wood. I assure you we make ourselves
very comfortable. We feed well from an hotel across the water.
The Froudes draw and paint. I have hired a violin, and bad
as it is, it sounds grand in such spacious halls. I write verses,
and get up some Italian, and walk up and down the rooms
about an hour and a half daily; and we have a boat, and
are allowed to go about the harbour.’ An incident on the
quarantine island is responsible, in Newman’s biography, for the
<!--119.png--><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pageno">91</span>
one and only tiff between himself and Froude.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_105" id="fnanchor_105"></a><a href="#footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></span> In reality, it
was no tiff at all, as Froude was wholly innocent of offence.
(Newman, it may be remarked in passing, had just written his
<cite>David and Jonathan</cite>.) It seems that during the January nights
in the Lazaretto, all three of the English travellers used to hear
unaccountable footsteps, in the rooms and galleries, their own
doors having been locked from the outside. On one occasion
Newman thought he heard the noises in Archdeacon Froude’s
room. ‘The fourth time it occurred, I hallooed out: “Who’s
there?” and sat up in my bed ready to spring out. A deep
silence followed, and I sat waiting a considerable time: and
thus I caught my cold.’ A week later, there is no clean
bill of health to send Mrs. Newman. ‘The weather has been
unusually severe here. My cold caught in the Lazaret ripened
the day I came out of it into the most wretched cough I ever
recollect having, as hard as the stone walls, and far more tight
than the windows.’ In short, Newman was housebound, a
close prisoner, and miserable enough, despite his successful
completing of his ‘Patriarchal Sonnets.’ Archdeacon Froude
forbade his going out to Church. The next day, Monday, he
confides to the all-sympathetic bosom of his family: ‘I am
properly taken at my word. I have been sighing for rest
and quiet. This is the sixth day since I left the Lazaret, and I
have hardly seen or spoken to anyone. The Froudes dine
out every day; and are out all the morning, of course. Last
night I put a blister on my chest; and never having had one
on before, you may fancy my awkwardness in taking it off and
dressing the place of it this morning. I ought to have had
four hands. Our servant was with the Froudes…. Well, I
am set upon a solitary life, and therefore ought to have
experience what it is; nor do I repent…. I have sent to
the library, and got <cite>Marriage</cite><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_106" id="fnanchor_106"></a><a href="#footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></span> to read. Don’t smile&mdash;this
juxtaposition is quite accidental! You are continually in my
thoughts. I know what kindness I should have at home.’
He ends dismally, not without citing the Apostolic precedent
<!--120.png--><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pageno">92</span>
of going not alone but two and two: ‘I wonder how long I
shall last without any friend about me!’ One can imagine
the anxiety and indignation of the devoted hearts at Iffley.
Early in April their unfriended John Henry received his sister
Jemima’s answer, distinctly uncomplimentary to Hurrell Froude;
whereupon Newman rushed into explanation: he could not
have Froude blamed; he had begged to be left alone (‘you
know I can be very earnest in entreating to be left alone’): he
had refused his repeated solicitations even to let him sit by him
and read to him; he had, in short, driven him away. Hurrell,
indeed, was not cut out by Nature for a nurse. Be that as it
may, would it be far wrong to surmise that it was influenza which
had been playing its now-well-understood tricks on Newman?
But he made up like a lover for his passing semi-accusation.
Froude, as it happened, was singularly well at this time,
though the reprieve from discomfort was to be but brief.</p>

<p>The three companions went from Malta to Messina, where,
in wretched weather, they had divers small misadventures,
shared with Rohan-Chabots. Hurrell kept, that week, a sort of
journal of events; and the pages describing the capture of
lodgings at Palermo seem worth transcription, since they show
the revered Vicar of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary-the-Virgin defeated by female
diplomacy, and in the unexpected rôle of a sprinter.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_107" id="fnanchor_107"></a><a href="#footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">‘We got to Palmero about eleven or twelve next morning
[<abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 11, 1833]: the sea calm, the sun hot, and everything
beautiful to a degree. Here we knew that there was to be a
scramble for rooms; so when we anchored, [Newman] and I
made a rush for the ladder, and were first in the boat; but
unfortunately, when we were in it we found that we had
mistaken the landing-place. Our boat was nearest the Quay;
and we had to clear out round all the others to make for the
custom-house and town, which were a mile off; also, our boat
had only one man. So we saw two other boats give us the
go-by, in one of which was the wife of the Governor of
Moldavia and Wallachia:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_108" id="fnanchor_108"></a><a href="#footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></span> they landed about four minutes
<!--121.png--><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span class="pageno">93</span>
before us, and we thought to make up our way by running.
I was soon left behind by [Newman] and the boatman. When
they passed the Countess, I saw her tap a fellow on the
shoulder, who ran off for a coach, in which she set off as hard
as she could for the Albergo di Londra. We found afterward
that she had secured Page’s whole house by letter; and not
contented with this, she had two servants ahead, who, when
[Newman] came up with them, raced him; and being fresh,
they contrived to keep ahead by a foot or two, so as just to
bespeak Jaquerie’s whole house before he could speak to the
landlord. On this, we despaired, and put up with the first
place we could find to hide our noses in: luckily, it had no
fleas! and that was more than we had bargained for.’
Newman, in his own letters, does not single out for praise the
one negative charm of their temporary dwelling. “It is
astonishing,” he says from the depth of English decency, “how
our standard falls in these parts!”</p>

<p>The Archdeacon, with his attendant spirits, was off at four
in the morning for Egesta. They had a carriage to themselves,
drawn by three mules with bells, and a boy and a guide,
besides the driver; much æsthetic rapture and next to nothing
to eat, seems to have been their portion. But the culminating
point, the complete satisfaction of the heart’s desire, was Rome.
‘All the cities I ever saw are but as dust, even dear Oxford
inclusive, compared with its majesty and glory,’ writes
Newman to the Rose Hill auditory. This enthusiasm of his
was not without its scruples and torments. He adds an
occasional colophon of genuine self-comfort, being sure that
‘our creed,’ the while, is ‘purer than the Roman’: a matter
which, apparently, Hurrell forgot to dwell upon. He never had
to rid himself of the least taint of the Pharisee, although he
had been scandalised enough at Naples. That alien city of
all badness had given his notions of its nominal religion
a rude shock. Frederick William Faber, passing through
Cologne in 1839, got, unwillingly, the very same sort of
painful disedification which Froude got at Naples.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_109" id="fnanchor_109"></a><a href="#footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></span> The
<!--122.png--><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pageno">94</span>
sadness of the decay of an ideal, even though a misplaced and
mistimed one, hangs over some of the letters sped towards holy
Oxford.</p>

<p class="p2 center">To the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <span class="smcap">John Keble</span>, March 16, 1833.</p>

<p>‘<i>Rome.</i>&mdash;… I should like to be back at the election much;
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sed fata vetant</i>. Being abroad is a most unsatisfactory thing,
and the idleness of it deteriorating. I shall connect very few
pleasing associations with this winter, and I don’t think I shall
come home much wiser than I went. The only <ins title="mathêsis">μάθησις</ins> on
which I can put my hand, as having resulted from my travels
is, that the whole Christian system all over Europe “<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">tendit
visibiliter ad non esse</cite>.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_110" id="fnanchor_110"></a><a href="#footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></span> The same process which is going on
in England and France is taking its course everywhere else;
and the clergy in these Catholic countries seem as completely
to have lost their influence, and to submit as tamely to the
State, as ever we can do in England…. Egesta … by
good luck we have been able to see, though we were obliged to
abandon the rest of our Sicilian expedition. It is the most
strangely romantic place I ever saw or conceived.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_111" id="fnanchor_111"></a><a href="#footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></span> It is no
use attempting to describe it, except that the ruins of the city
stand on the top of a very high hill, precipitous on three sides,
and very steep on the other, literally towering up to heaven,
with scarcely a mule-track leading to it, and all round the
appearance of an interminable solitude. After going some miles
through a wild uninhabited country, you approach it by winding
up a zigzag path cut in the face of what looks a perpendicular
and inaccessible rock, and, till you have got some way up, it
wears so little the appearance of a track, that without guides
no one would venture on. At the top the old walls of the
town can be distinctly traced, where one would think that
mortal foot had never or rarely been, and numbers of tooled
stones [are] scattered in all directions, evidently the remains of
<!--123.png--><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="pageno">95</span>
well-finished buildings. Here and there is a broken arch
which makes one fancy the remains to be Roman, and in the
most conspicuous place a fine theatre, nearly perfect. When
you come to the ascent on the opposite side, you all at once
see the Temple, in what seems a plain at the bottom, with its
pediments and all its columns perfect, and only differing from
what it was at first in the deep rich colouring of the weather-stains.
When we saw it there was a large encampment of
shepherds in the front of it, with their wolf-dogs and wild
Salvator-like dresses; and, by-the-by, as we found afterwards,
with no great objection to lead Salvator-like lives; for when
by some accident we were separated from one another, they
got round [Newman] shouting “<cite>Date moneta!</cite>” and, he thinks,
would certainly have taken it by force, except for a man with
a gun who is placed there by Government, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">custode</i> of the
Temple, and who came up when the others were getting most
troublesome. On getting close to the Temple, we found that
it stands on the brink of a precipitous ravine 200 or 300 feet
deep, which gives a grandeur to the whole scene even beyond
what it gets from the mountains and the solitude. Compared
with Egesta, Pæstum is a poor concern, and so is Naples when
compared with Palermo.</p>

<p>‘But Rome is the place, after all, where there is most to
astonish one, and [it is] of all ages, even the present. I don’t
know that I take much interest in the relics of the Empire,
magnificent as they are, although there is something
sentimental in seeing (as one literally may), the cows and
oxen <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Romanoque foro et lautis mugire Carinis</i>. But the thing
which most takes possession of one’s mind is the entire
absorption of the old Roman splendour in an unthought-of
system: to see their columns, and marbles, and bronzes, which
had been brought together at such an immense cost, all
diverted from their first objects, and taken up by Christianity:
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul standing at the top of Trajan’s and
Antonine’s columns, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter buried in the Circus of
Nero, with all the splendour of Rome concentrated in his
mausoleum. The immense quantity of rare marbles, which
are the chief ornament of the Churches here, could scarcely have
been collected except by the centre of an universal Empire,
<!--124.png--><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pageno">96</span>
which had not only unlimited wealth at its command, but access
to almost every country; and now one sees all this dedicated
to the Martyrs. Before I came here I had no idea of the
effect of coloured stone in architecture; but the use Michael
Angelo has made of it in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s shows one at once how
entirely that style is designed with reference to it, and how
absurd it was in Sir C. Wren to copy the form when he could
copy nothing more. The coloured part so completely
disconnects itself from the rest, and forms such an elegant and
decided relief to it, that the two seem like independent designs
that do not interfere. The plain stone-work has all the
simplicity of a Grecian temple, and the marbles set it off just
as a fine scene or a glowing sky would. I observe that the
awkwardness of mixing up arched and unarched architecture is
thus entirely avoided, as all the arched work is coloured, and
the lines of the uncoloured part are all either horizontal or
perpendicular. So Michael Angelo adds his testimony to my
theory about Gothic architecture.</p>

<p>‘As to Raphael’s pictures, I have not had time to study
them with attention. The most celebrated of them, especially
your friend Heliodorus, are so damaged or dirty that one cannot
see them distinctly except close; they say we should use
an opera-glass. All that the painters say of Raphael tends to
exalt him as a poet and a man of genius, but rather at the
expense of his technical skill; he and Michael Angelo seem, by
what they say, to be counterparts. But I wish I could hope
to form an opinion of my own about it.</p>

<p>‘There is an English artist here, a Mr. S[evern],<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_112" id="fnanchor_112"></a><a href="#footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></span> to whom
[Newman] had an introduction, and who certainly is a very
clever man, who gave us a most curious and interesting account
of a German school of painters that is now growing up in
Rome. He says that several of them are here, living on
pensions from German Princes, particularly the King of Bavaria,
and are studying Raphael in a very singular way: curious
fellows, with a great deal of original enthusiasm (utterly unlike
the <ins title="banausoi">βαναυσοί</ins> of England), who have got it into their heads that
the way to study Raphael is not to copy him, but to study the
works he studied, and to put their mind into the attitude in
<!--125.png--><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="pageno">97</span>
which he formed his conceptions. So they poke away at the
old hard pictures of early Masters, with stiff drapery and gilt
backgrounds, and are so intent on dissociating Christian and
classical art, that they think grace and beauty bought too dear,
if they tend to disturb the mind by pagan associations. One
of these fellows,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_113" id="fnanchor_113"></a><a href="#footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></span> he said, had become intimate with him in a
curious way. Mr. S[evern] has made colouring his principal
study; he seems to be a bit of an enthusiast himself, and has
been aiming at combining the colouring of the Venetian school
with the designs of the Roman. Well, this German, who is a
shy, reserved man, having been one day in Mr. S[evern’s]
studio, returned the next day with ten or twelve of his German
friends, and again, the day after, with as many more; and so
on, for some time. At last Mr. S[evern], who took it as a great
compliment, asked him what it was that had attracted his
notice. He said he had always gone on a notion that colour
had nothing to do with the poetry of painting, but was merely
sensual, and that a Madonna he had seen of Mr. S[evern’s]
made him alter his mind; so he had been bringing friends to
see if they felt the same about it. Since this time they have
been very intimate; but the man is so reserved, in general, that
except for this accident he might have kept his notions to himself.
Mr. S[evern] says his designs are quite in the spirit of
Raphael, and that his whole mind is so taken up with Catholic
<ins title="êthos">ἦθος</ins>, that he has given up his Protestantism, and is a rigid
conformer to all the ordinances of the Church. I have prosed
about this because I was struck with it. I hope it is no mare’s
nest…. I don’t know whether I mentioned to you that
[Newman] and [Williams] are going to indite verses for <cite>The

<p>‘… If you choose, you may easily find out in London what
is the particular process by which the red colour of glass is produced
from gold, and also in what way they would go to work
to give glass a vitrified coat of gold, retaining its own colour;
and whether any accident in attempting the latter might effect
the former. For it has always struck me as a puzzle how so
recondite an idea as that of producing a ruby tint from a
yellow metal should come into the heads of the early glass-painters;
and it has occurred to me that some such accident
as I have guessed at above might be the key to the puzzle, for
the practice of giving glass a vitrified coat of gold for the purpose
of mosaic work was very common, long before the use of
coloured glass in windows had been thought of, and specimens
of it are to be seen in Rome of almost every age between
[<span class="muchsmaller">A.D.</span>] 400 and [<span class="muchsmaller">A.D.</span>] 1000. Please not to forget this question,
or be contented with vague answers. It will be likely
to take some time and trouble to get at the truth, but it is
curious, and there is no hurry, and you will at any rate have
more opportunities than I shall. The best red colour that has
been produced in modern times has been managed by a French
chemist, and there is a wholesale house of his goods somewhere
in Holborn. The Pope’s mosaic manufactory in Rome is
curious: there are eighteen thousand shades of colour in it,
which can be looked out as in a directory. Some of the
imitations of pictures which they have made are so perfect that
you must look close before you can see joinings and transitions
of colour; and they have the advantage over every kind of
painting, being mellow from the first and brilliant to the last.
In <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s there are many very fine ones, copies of all the
most famous pictures, and they are said to have cost 4500<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> a
piece. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s itself is the great attraction of Rome, worth
all the classics put together. I think the dome is built with
<!--128.png--><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pageno">100</span>
all the layers of stone horizontal, so that the principle of the
arch applies not to the vertical section, but only to the horizontal.
I am not sure of this, but I think so.’</p>

<p class="p2">It does not appear, though Newman and Froude saw the
Pope’s mosaic manufactory, that they saw the Pope himself,
Gregory <abbr title="sixteen"><span class="muchsmaller">XVI.</span></abbr> They seem to have gained their chief vistas of
Roman society through their acquaintance with the Prussian
Chargé d’Affaires, Baron Bunsen,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_117" id="fnanchor_117"></a><a href="#footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></span> and his English wife, at
whose house of all hospitality Sir Walter Scott, then near
his end, had been the beloved guest less than a year before.
Hurrell must have had his own impressions of the excellent
Bunsen, with his pleasant Teutonic habit of holding up his
finger and hushing the company, before he began to speak.
There is no mention of our modest and all-observing pilgrims
in the published correspondence either of Bunsen or of Joseph
Severn, for 1832-1833.</p>

<p>On April 13, 1833, Hurrell sends to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John
Frederick Christie one of the most discussed letters in the
first volume of the <cite>Remains</cite>.</p>

<p>‘It would not become me to apologise for not having
written before, since I much doubt my capacity<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_118" id="fnanchor_118"></a><a href="#footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></span> to produce
anything worth the postage. Nevertheless, I have for some
time been intending to write to you, and can’t account for
having let so much time slip through my fingers. My father
and I are now on our way home, having left [Newman] to retrace
his steps to Sicily…. I hope to be at Genoa to-morrow
morning…. Between [Lyons] and Paris, I hope to visit and
make drawings of some of the Abbeys, etc., which are connected
with the history of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas of Cant. “Sixth and lastly,” if
the Fates allow, we shall cross from Havre to Southampton by
the first steamer in May … soon after which you may expect
to see me in Chapel. I congratulate you on having got over
your first audit so prosperously;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_119" id="fnanchor_119"></a><a href="#footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></span> … it is better occupation than
<!--129.png--><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pageno">101</span>
travelling, take my word for it. It is really melancholy to
think how little one has got for one’s time and money. The
only thing I can put my hand on as an acquisition is having
formed an acquaintance with a man of some influence at
Rome, Monsignor [Wiseman]<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_120" id="fnanchor_120"></a><a href="#footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></span> the head of the [English]
College, who has enlightened [Newman] and me on the subject
of our relations to the Church of Rome. We got introduced
to him to find out whether they would take us<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_121" id="fnanchor_121"></a><a href="#footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></span> in on any
terms to which we could twist our consciences, and we found
to our dismay that not one step could be gained without
swallowing the Council of Trent as a whole! We made our
approaches to the subject as delicately as we could. Our first
notion was that the terms of communion were, within certain
limits, under the control of the Pope … or, that in case he could
not dispense solely, yet at any rate the acts of one Council
might be rescinded by another; indeed, that in Charles the
First’s time it had been intended to negociate a reconciliation
on the terms on which things stood before the Council of
Trent. But we found, to our horror, that the doctrine of the
Infallibility of the Church made the acts of each successive
Council obligatory for ever, that what had been once decided
could never be meddled with again, in fact, that they were
committed finally and irrevocably, and could not advance one
step to meet us, even though the Church of England should
again become what it was in Laud’s time….</p>

<p>‘… So much for the Council of Trent, for which Christendom
has to thank Luther and the Reformers. [Newman] declares
that ever since I heard this I have become a staunch Protestant,
which is a most base calumny on his part, though I own it
has altogether changed my notions of the Roman Catholics,
and made me wish for a total overthrow of their system. I
think that the only <ins title="topos">τόπος</ins> now is “the ancient Church of
England,” and, as an explanation of what one means, “Charles
the First” and “the Nonjurors.” When I come home I mean to
<!--130.png--><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pageno">102</span>
read and write all sorts of things; for now that one is a Radical,
there is no use in being nice!<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_122" id="fnanchor_122"></a><a href="#footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></span> I wish you had sent a longer
postscript to [Newman] about the position of things; all I have
heard, directly or indirectly, has made me long to be home
again. You don’t say whether you have done anything for
the <cite>L[yra] A[postolica]</cite>?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_123" id="fnanchor_123"></a><a href="#footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></span>…. Tell [Isaac Williams] that I
think he has used me basely to send me a mere scribble of
a few lines, prosing about some theory of poetry, when there
were such a lot of atrocities going on on all sides, of which
one can get no tolerable account through the papers.</p>

<p>‘<span class="date">Genoa, April 15.</span>&mdash;Here we are, as at Leghorn, detained
a day beyond our time, though there is a perfect calm, because
these absurd fellows are afraid of a swell which was got up by
last night’s wind. The more I have to do with these wretched
Neapolitans, the more my first impressions about them are
confirmed. I wonder how anyone can tolerate either them or
their town, which is as nasty and uninteresting a place as I
ever set foot in. As to this Genoa, I should not grumble at
being detained here, if I were in plight for sight-seeing, for it
is truly magnificent, both in itself and in its situation; but,
unfortunately, I was taken with a very severe feverish cold the
morning we landed, <i>i.e.</i>, the day before yesterday; and that
day and yesterday was confined to my bed, where I should
probably be now but that I had to get up early, in hopes the
vessel would keep its appointment…. Never advise a friend
of yours to come abroad for his health! It would be very
well if one could have Fortunatus’ cap, and wish one’s self at
Rome; but travelling does more harm than change of climate
does good.</p>

<p>‘While we were at Rome [Newman] and I tried hard to get
up the march-of-mind phraseology about pictures and statues,
and we hoped we were making some little progress under the
<!--131.png--><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pageno">103</span>
auspices of a clever English artist, to whom we had an introduction:
but, unfortunately for our peace of mind, just before
our departure we became acquainted with [a Fellow of Trinity
College, Cambridge], who, though he had not been in Italy
much longer than ourselves, had attained an eminence so far
beyond what we could even in thought aspire to, that we
gave the thing up in despair, and retire upon the <ins title="topos">τόπος</ins>, that
“we don’t enter into [those] technicalities.” Certainly those
C[ambridge] men are wonderful fellows; I know no one but
[Head]<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_124" id="fnanchor_124"></a><a href="#footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></span> that could compete with them at all. They know
everything, examine everything, and dogmatise about everything;
they have paid particular attention to the geological
structure of this place, and the botany of that, and the agriculture
of another, and they are antiquaries, and artists, and
scholars, and, above all, puff off one another with the assiduity
of our friends the [W.]s. W[hewell’s]<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_125" id="fnanchor_125"></a><a href="#footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></span> book, and S[edgwick’s]<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_126" id="fnanchor_126"></a><a href="#footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></span>
Lectures, and T[hirlwall’s]<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_127" id="fnanchor_127"></a><a href="#footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></span> research, and H[are’s]<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_128" id="fnanchor_128"></a><a href="#footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></span> taste, pop
upon one at every turn…. We mean to make as much as
we can out of our acquaintance with Monsignor [Wiseman],
who (by the by), is really too nice a person to talk nonsense
about. He desired me to apply to him, if on any future
occasion I had to consult the Vatican Library: and a transaction
of that sort would sound well….’</p>

<p>The ‘transaction would sound well’: this, as if the writer’s
study were only to heighten others’ opinion of him! Newman
was surely right in calling attention, years after, to this habit
<!--132.png--><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pageno">104</span>
of Froude’s of depreciating, nay, belying, his own motives. It
was not an affectation, but it was a little piece of sheer cruelty.</p>

<p class="p2">The friends had parted at Rome, the Froudes very loath
to leave Newman behind; and he, on his part, roaming about
the Janiculum after they had gone, in a silent passion of grief,
reproaching himself for his wilful fancy to return, under a
sort of romantic obsession, to Sicily alone. There he was all
but destined to meet an untimely death. Hurrell finished his
long letter to Mr. Christie as he moved homeward.</p>

<p>‘<span class="date">Marseilles, April 22.</span>&mdash;This France is certainly a most
delicious place: we landed in Hyères Bay, owing to a storm
from the north-west, and found everything so warm and green
that I could quite enter into John of Salisbury’s<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_129" id="fnanchor_129"></a><a href="#footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></span> feelings.
The people, too, [are] so extremely civil that I cannot help
hoping there may yet be the seven thousand in Israel, and that
sometime or other we may be able to talk of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la belle France</i>
with some kind of pleasure. I feel like a great fool here, from
not being able to talk French. In Italy half the population
kept me in countenance, but here it is a constant humiliation.
And what is worst, I can’t hope to make progress; for having
learned the little I know by writing and not [by] speaking, I
annex wrong-shaped words to all the sounds. It is like talking
Latin<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_130" id="fnanchor_130"></a><a href="#footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></span> to a foreigner.’</p>

<p>Again, on May 23, to William Froude, is expressed
further commendation of the French people, founded on the
keenest instinctive understanding of them: an understanding
even more unusual then than now. Newman, until later, was
certainly far from sharing it, or wishing to learn to share it.
The ordinary attitude of the contemporary Oxford mind was
frankly, though playfully expressed, by the young W. R. Churton,
some years before. He gallantly addresses France: ‘What
have I seen in thee that should make me long to see thee
again? Have I seen a gentleman from Calais to Beauvoisin?
<!--133.png--><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pageno">105</span>
Have I seen one gleam of poetry in the country or its inhabitants?’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_131" id="fnanchor_131"></a><a href="#footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></span>
Hurrell Froude was ‘un-English’ enough to
be arrested, but not repelled, while on the Continent, by the
spectacle of extra-English human nature. We have heard
him longing, at Zante, to ‘live among them a bit, and get
into their notions.’ This beautiful and uncommon openness
of mind stamps him an ideal traveller, despite his lack of
opportunity; at no single point of a hurried route, beset with
difficulties, could he look far below the surface of things. But
it is strikingly inaccurate to say of him, as Mr. Mozley does,
that he lacked not only opportunity, but curiosity, ‘to see
the interior of either the political or the religious systems they
came upon.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_132" id="fnanchor_132"></a><a href="#footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>‘What I have seen since my last letter ends, has been
more interesting than anything else except Rome. We stopped
about at many places in the central part of France, to see out-of-the-way
things connected with Becket’s history, and found
some of them so very curious and striking in themselves, that
they would have amply repaid us by their own merits. But
what I was most interested with was, that the French seem to
me to have been so grossly belied as a nation. I never saw a
people that tempted me to like them so much, on a superficial
observation. I declare, if I was called upon to make a definition
of their national character, I should say they were a
primitive innocent people. The fact seems to be that France
is governed by a small despotic oligarchy, the aristocracy of
wealth, who by their agitating spirit have contrived to get the
franchise so restricted as to secure to themselves a majority in
the Chamber, and the command of the military, by which they
keep France under such a strong hand…. There is now in
France a High Church party who are Republicans,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_133" id="fnanchor_133"></a><a href="#footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></span> and wish
for universal suffrage, on the ground that in proportion as the
franchise falls lower the influence of the Church makes itself
more felt; at present its limits about coincide with those of
<!--134.png--><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pageno">106</span>
the infidel faction. Don’t be surprised if one of these days
you find us turning Radicals on similar grounds.’</p>

colophon, stands under his separate <ins title="beta">β</ins> after Keble’s poem, in
every edition, as if by some solemn little rubrical observance.
Both Keble and Newman were most careful, in all these delicate
ways, to preserve their friend’s least touch upon the early
printed work of the Movement. It was his death which led
to the revelation of the authorship of all the poems in <cite>Lyra
Apostolica</cite>. They would else have remained strictly anonymous.
‘One of the writers in whom the work originated,’
says Newman in his very brief preface, dated at Oxford on All
Saints’ Day of 1836, ‘having been taken from his friends …
it seemed desirable … to record what belonged to him, while
it was possible to do so; and this has led to a general discrimination
of the poems, by signatures at the end of each.’</p>

<p>Two days after ‘Trembling Hope,’ on June 28, Hurrell

<p>Four other sacred poems which Hurrell wrote in 1833
may as well be given here. He and Newman burst into song
together, though he with far more remote and infrequent music.
Probably no lyrist ever had such a poor opinion of himself.
But in the qualities of clearness, simplicity, orderly thought and
noble severity, there is something very remarkable in Hurrell’s
few brief scattered verses. They have a strong singleness and
sad transparency, the tone of them a little chilly, yet almost
Virgilian, and arrestingly beautiful; they, like himself, are
impersonal, and full of character; abstinent, concentrated, true.
The unexpected grace is their cunning harmony, and the trick of
that is neither derived nor deliberately invented. His every line
instinctively sings and flies. He has nothing to match a certain
refrain of Newman’s, in what he calls his ‘ecclesiastical carol,’<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

It is a good instance of an always interesting literary
anomaly that such a line, in its raucous sibilation, should have
been produced by an accomplished musician, whereas unfailing
melody belongs to Froude, who, loving naturally what he once
called ‘the bright and silent pleasures of poetry,’ had small
sense of music as an independent art. Yet Newman certainly
was capable of a sustained grandeur, as in his verses on
Greek models, which Froude did not attempt, and could not
attain.</p>

<p>From poetical ‘dotings,’ Hurrell, having reached England,
throws himself gladly into the interests of the young scientist
his brother, who was already at work on the unique experiments
concerning the resistance and propulsion of ships, which now
stand connected, all over the world, with his successful name.
He was going forward to be, as Hurrell anxiously wished, no
‘mere engineer,’ no ‘Liberal,’ <i>i.e.</i>, agnostic or materialist, ‘at
heart.’</p>

<p class="p2 center">To <span class="smcap">William Froude</span>, July 11, 1833.</p>

<p>‘… I cannot understand how the dock-gates can make
any further resistance to the water after the curvature has been
squatted out of them, nor how, if the curvature is right, the
pressure should have any tendency to alter it. Tell me if you
succeed in getting a verdict against them; also, how your
resistance experiments succeed. I will never believe that a
sail will do as much work if you split it in two; but, if R ∝ area,
you might have each cloth independent, and all would do as
<!--141.png--><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pageno">113</span>
well. I never gave you an answer about the Book of Job, for
I cannot get a distinct idea of its argument. It is said to be
a discussion on the moral government of God; but my view
of it is not more distinct than what ladies get of Butler’s
<cite>Analogy</cite>.’</p>

<p>Honest Hurrell and his baffled Willy were looking for the
sort of intellectual company which misery is said to love, and
found it in ‘ladies.’ These, as yet, were certainly busier with
worsted samplers than with the problems of the educated.</p>

<p class="p2">On July 14, the day of the storming of the feudal Bastille,
came the formal start of another revolution which had a quieter,
but no less ominous foot. Mr. Keble mounted the pulpit stair
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary-the-Virgin’s at Oxford, and preached his memorable
Assize Sermon, which went to press under its title of <cite>National
Apostasy</cite>. It served as a bugle to let men know that the work
of recapturing Faith for England had begun, and that ‘things
have come to the pretty pass’ (in Lord Melbourne’s celebrated
expression), ‘that religion is to invade the sphere of private
life!’ There had been long preliminary agitation, and much
personal consciousness, especially on Newman’s part and on
Froude’s, of ‘a work to do in England.’</p>

<p>Secular authority was on the eve of abolishing in Ireland
ten Bishoprics, which, in that country at least, it is not pretended
that it had not created. But there could be no
guarantee whatever that secular authority, so gorged, would be
sated; and operations in England being only too likely, it was
time for the objectors to rise. Besides, the general change
effected during 1832-3, in the relations of Church and State,
was the most disheartening or enraging thing in the world to
the sentinels at Oxford, according to individual mood. Up to
then, ‘spiritual cases were referred by the Sovereign to the Court
of Delegates, which contained a majority of spiritual persons.
But in those years, the final appeal was transferred, by Act of
Parliament, from the Court of Delegates to, first, the Privy
Council, and then a Committee formed from it.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_143" id="fnanchor_143"></a><a href="#footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></span> In that bondage,
a worthy legacy from the ‘unidea’d’ reign of William <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr></span>,
<!--142.png--><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pageno">114</span>
the Church of England stood, and stands. Things had been
bad enough before. Already Hurrell had cried out in private:
‘The Church can never right itself without a blow-up.’ This
was more sanguine than Dr. Arnold’s simultaneous jeremiad,
and quite as loyal. ‘The Church as it now stands,’ he said,
‘no human power can save.’ But now Froude’s song is: ‘If
the State would but kick us off!’ caught from Lamennais and
the great democrat-Ultramontane agitation in France. The
wish is translated into the weighty and telling pages of the long
essay which stands first in his <cite>Remains</cite>, and which he wrote in
1833. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">More suo</i>, he uses in it all the original documents
which he can lay his hands on, and furthers his argument by
italicisation and capitalisation of leading words and phrases.
Ambrose Phillipps de Lisle once remarked that the step of
throwing off the supremacy of the State had been dreamed
of, in England, only by the Nonjurors, and ‘the first authors
of the <cite>Tracts for the Times</cite>.’ Has it not been dreamed of ever
since? The deification of a Privy Council was the occasion,
not the cause, of the High Anglican onset, itself but one
movement of several against the intrenchments of British
materialism, but distinct from them all, inasmuch as Scott and
Coleridge, riding just before, with the armed protest of Carlyle,
of Ruskin, and of Emerson to follow, bore no known emblems
of a Christian Crusade. The hour of latent dissatisfaction had
crept up to flood-water mark. As we are well aware, no great
movement springs full-armed from the brain of any local
Jupiter; and this one was a birth, and only a birth, of 1833.
For years previously, semi-active agitation, fed by the feeling
all over the country, was quite patent and open. There was
much popular stir and screaming, all making, no doubt, for
righteousness and right ideas. The thinkers, the Universities,
were far clearer as to what they did not mean, or wish, than
as to what they did. ‘Newman and I are both so consequential,’
Froude writes in a leave-taking letter of 1832, ‘that we
fear all sorts of things going wrong while we are away.’ It
is perfectly true that these men did not create, but evoke, the
religious spirit of their time. The Chinese narcissus bourgeons
at a miraculous rate from a bulb a year old. The Platonic
theory of individual knowledge should be extended to meet
<!--143.png--><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><span class="pageno">115</span>
the case of nations: they, too, remember, and have rhythms
which antedate the conscious life, and recur throughout it.
We are always forgetting the commonplace that a spirit rather
than intelligent persons with a polity, a law rather than its
visible agencies, is the true operative force. Well-meaning
students of the Movement have looked upon one name or
another as the generating cause, whereas the real leader is ever
nameless, like Odysseus in the cave of his baffled giant. There
was ‘an unseen agitator,’ as Newman knew. His earliest friend
of undergraduate days, whom he called, afterwards, <cite>Princeps
Apostolicorum</cite>, was, for one, independently aware of it, as
soon as events began.</p>

<p>‘… What a wonderful drama is going on,’ Mr. Bowden<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_144" id="fnanchor_144"></a><a href="#footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></span>
writes, ‘if we could but trace it as a whole, and know the
multiplied bearings of each varied scene upon our nation and
our Church! However, we can see our own parts, and that
must for the present suffice us.’ Newman confessed the same
wide vision, writing later in that year to Froude: ‘I do
verily believe a spirit is abroad at present, and we are but
blind tools, not knowing whither we are going. I mean,
a flame seems arising in so many places as to show no
mortal incendiary is at work, though this man or that may
have more influence in shaping the course, or modifying the
nature of the flame.’</p>

<p>‘This man or that’ was not lacking, and there was
work for him: work for ‘the bright, vivacious, and singularly
lovable figures with whom the eyes of Oriel men were then
familiarised.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_145" id="fnanchor_145"></a><a href="#footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></span> Mr. Charles Kingsley thought them, as it
would appear, not ‘virile’: a necessary opinion for any ‘virile’
Kingsley to hold. So much depends upon definition! It
was a passing conversational remark made by Hurrell Froude
concerning the great Churchmen of the Middle Ages, that their
portraits had ‘a curious expression as of neither man nor
woman, a kind of feminine sternness.’ A very similar remark
was made at almost the same moment by the prince of
English metaphysical critics. Of the coincidence Froude was
<!--144.png--><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><span class="pageno">116</span>
not aware; but his Editors, in a footnote, fail not to refer to it.
‘[Wordsworth’s] face is almost the only exception I know,’
said Coleridge, ‘to the observation that something feminine,
(not effeminate, mind!) is discoverable in the countenances of
all men of genius.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_146" id="fnanchor_146"></a><a href="#footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></span> This angelic or epicene aspect is, indicatively,
the most terrible force in the world. It is certain that
the Tractarians lacked the girth, the gait, the entire and
triumphant visibility of John Bull going out with his gun.
They lived with abstract ideas, and came to look like them.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Froude, if anyone,’ wrote Newman anonymously in
<cite>The British Critic</cite> of April, 1839, ‘gained his views from
his own mind.’ But indeed, as is implied, none of us ever gain
our views from our own minds: views coming with an underived
spontaneous air are born of a man’s superior attentiveness
to the working Mind of things. Hurrell, pacing Trinity
Gardens, his hand on Williams’ shoulder, with the off-hand
edict: ‘Isaac, we must make a Row in the world!’ recalls
to us another agitator of whimsical disinterestedness, Camille
Desmoulins. Or he is speaking a too free translation of the
message of high and urgent poetry which La Pucelle once
poured into the ears of Durand Laxart at Domremy. (It is
always of French genius that his genius reminds us.) In all
the polemics of the day his voice is the Æolian one, fitful and
laconic, unexpected and alarming, yet oddly sweet. He is
very busy chastising and correcting himself; but that other
strife going on is far more interesting: he is a soldier of
fortune, he must fight, he must interfere. When the outriders
of the whole sea of returning Catholicism charge at first singly
and silently, then with uproar, along the levels of the sleeping
Protestant kingdom, the Hurrell Froude who loved duty and
hard work, and abhorred display and conspicuosity, rises,
<!--145.png--><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><span class="pageno">117</span>
despite himself, a little dominant, a little spectacular. He is
inevitably marked, to ear and eye, as the legendary ninth
wave, the foamiest green breaker of the line, ever re-forming
and breaking, so long as he is visible, brighter, taller, and
farther in-shore than the rest. With the year 1833 he comes
into public play, and vanishes almost as soon.</p>

<p>‘… By the bye, I write [“Newman”] as if you knew he
was returned. He came back last Tuesday week.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_147" id="fnanchor_147"></a><a href="#footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></span>… He
has been delayed by what one can now look back on without
uneasiness, as he has not suffered eventually; but the fact is,
he has had a very narrow escape of his life, owing to a
severe epidemic fever which he caught in Sicily, and in a place
where he could get access to no kind of medical aid. At the
place where he was seized he was laid up for three days,
unable to move, and at the end of that time strangely took it
into his head that he was well. In consequence, he set out on
his journey, and after having gone about seven miles, was
carried almost lifeless into a cabin, just at a moment when, by
a strange accident, a medical man was passing. This person
relieved him sufficiently to enable his attendants to remove
him to a town some way farther on, in which a doctor resided:
Enna, or Castro Giovanni. Here he was eleven days before
the crisis of his fever arrived, and it was long thought he had
no chance of recovering…. He was afterwards delayed at
Palermo by the stupid vessel, which did not sail for three weeks
after it had promised, and thus lost all the advantages of a
good wind. However, he is back safe at last, and really looks
well, though his hair is all coming off, and his strength is not
yet thoroughly restored. Do something for the [Magazine] and
the <cite>Lyra</cite>. Wherefore stand ye all the day idle? I am going
to [Hadleigh] in an hour or two to concert measures.’</p>

<p class="p2">Hadleigh Rectory, in Suffolk, was the scene of the little
four-days’ congress called together on July 25, by the
independent Cambridge forerunner of the Movement, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
<!--146.png--><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span class="pageno">118</span>
Hugh James Rose; ‘the most eminent person of his generation
as a divine,’ Dean Church calls him. It is interesting to
recall that the young Richard Chevenix Trench was Curate
of Hadleigh at this time. Neither Keble nor Newman was
able to attend. It was the first rally of those willing to fight
‘for the doctrine of Apostolical Succession, and for the integrity
of the Prayer-Book’; and means were about to be taken to
found a powerful Association of Friends of the Church. Froude,
impatient of talk and of preliminaries, distrustful of the need
of organisations, cherishing a preference such as Newman was
to express long after, writing to Pusey, for ‘generating an
<ins title="êthos">ἦθος</ins> rather than a system,’ went down from Oxford somewhat
grumblingly. The subjects brought forward at Hadleigh
were chiefly disciplinary. The complicated relationship of
Church and State, the call for Lay Synods, and the ever-burning
topic of the manner of the Appointment of Bishops
in the Church of England, seem to have engrossed the four
men present, Froude then as always, in his extreme abstract
way, pushing on to conclusions the others were not ripe for.
He found Rose, disinterested as he knew him to be, ‘conservative’;
he lamented that Rose and Palmer of Worcester
clung to what he calls the ‘gentleman heresy,’ to ‘the old
prejudices about the expediency of having the clergy gentlemen,
<i>i.e.</i>, fit to mix in good society; and about “prizes” to
tempt men into the Church, and the whole train of stuff….
What I have learned,’ he adds, generalising, ‘is not to be
sanguine, not to expect to bring other people into my views
in a shorter time than I have been in coming to them myself.’
And again to Newman, with candour: ‘You seem to think I am
floored, and in fact, I partly am so; at least the predominant
impression left on my mind is that I am a poor hand at
entering into other people’s thoughts.’ There follows a description
of a fellow-guest, which must have made both Newman
and Keble smile, as being possibly applicable to another and
more fiery spirit who, as Mr. Rose their host said afterwards,
with his delicate Gallic justness of criticism, was ‘not afraid of
inferences.’ It can hardly be proved that Hurrell appreciated
Mr. Rose, who was a sort of precursor in Pusey’s spiritual
dynasty, as Hurrell himself was in Newman’s. But he overrated
<!--147.png--><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><span class="pageno">119</span>
Mr. Perceval. Newman was given to understand, at the
close of the session, on the thirtieth day of July, some of Mr.
Perceval’s excellences and moral dangers.</p>

<p>‘Perceval,’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_148" id="fnanchor_148"></a><a href="#footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></span> Hurrell writes, ‘is a very delightful fellow in <ins title="êthos">ἦθος</ins>,
a regular thorough-going Apostolical; but I think Keble should
warn him about putting himself in the way of excitement.
Some of the things he says and does make me feel rather odd.
I am sure he should be set to work on something dull that
would keep his thoughts from present interests. I never saw
a fellow who seemed more entirely absorbed, heart and soul,
in the cause of the Church, and without the remotest approach
to self-sufficiency.’</p>

<p>‘Both Rose and Palmer,’ wrote Newman on the other
hand, after he had heard from those allies, ‘think Froude
and Perceval very deficient in learning, and therefore rash.’
Considerable time had been spent in revising the <cite>Churchman’s
Manual</cite>, by Mr. Perceval. Books, committees, bylaws,
and such tangible machinery, seemed important to Mr.
Rose, who was intelligently planning a great local campaign,
to improve the position of his disadvantaged party. Froude,
ahead of Newman or Keble, seems from the first to have
outrun anything of this sort. To these three, the very
existence of religion, whether expressed in the public worship
and formularies, or in the conduct and belief of Englishmen,
was at stake. He alone lacked a just conception of minor
needs, what was the nature of these, or how far they should be
satisfied: he felt only the need of supernaturalism in a society
again grown godless since Wesley’s time. He did not,
therefore, march forward in order, but by a long leap threw
himself half-blindly upon ‘incomprehensibles, and thoughts of
things which thoughts do but tenderly touch.’ Certainly,
cohesion, as not being the note of the Church of England,
was not the note of the conference at Hadleigh. Froude
especially, with his terrible consistency, his capacity for getting
all there was to get out of the mere innuendoes and half-lights
of circumstance, his passion (to employ a serviceable
<!--148.png--><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="pageno">120</span>
expression of Locke’s) ‘to bottom everything,’ must have
obstructed unconsciously the deliberations of a great liturgiologist
and a true ecclesiastical statesman, both born to move
with caution, and to end in the deltas of compromise or sheer
weariness. Froude felt then, as afterwards, what he calls his
‘stigma of ultraism’; what really worried him more than that,
was the slow foot of reform, toiling behind his own. He wished
nothing less, as we have seen, than a ‘blow-up,’ and reconstruction.
His poetic foresight made him implacable; consequences,
not processes, were in his foreground. He had the
individual vision. Galahad-like, he saw, while wise men were
spurring up and down upon the quest. Mr. Palmer’s adjectives
were well chosen: Hurrell was not ‘learned,’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_149" id="fnanchor_149"></a><a href="#footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></span> and he
was ‘rash.’ But it is also true that learning will call anything
rashness which travels towards a given goal by a shorter
route than its own. An extremely fine definition of Froude’s
might be wrested from its context, and applied to his discomfiture
at Hadleigh, and his position in general. ‘The
understanding,’ he says, ‘pursues something which it does
not know by means which it does; while genius endeavours to
effect what it has a previous idea of, by means of which it
has to ascertain the use.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_150" id="fnanchor_150"></a><a href="#footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></span> The ‘bold rider across country’
would perhaps look unnatural as a mounted collaborator in a
procession. It is to be feared that the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Richard Hurrell
Froude was a difficult factor, a Montagnard, in the debates of
nascent Anglo-Catholicism.</p>

<p>In the strife of ideas, during the summer, there were not
lacking pastoral interludes.</p>

<p class="p2 center">To the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <span class="smcap">John Keble</span>, August, 1833.</p>

<p>‘… You can’t think what delicious weather we have had
here [at Dartington]. It is like May back again…. I saw
the other night what I can hardly convince myself not to have
<!--149.png--><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pageno">121</span>
been a supernatural fire. I and one of the [Champernownes?]
and two other boys, and a labourer, were coming up the river
in a boat when it was dark, and we all saw as distinctly as
possible under a tree, close by the water, what we took for
a wood fire: hot embers, which did not blaze, but gave off
sparks; the boys thought a wasp’s nest must have been burned
out there, and landed to stir up the embers and examine;
in landing we lost sight of the fire for a minute behind the
bush, and in going to the place found nothing; no smell of
burning, no ashes, no marks of fire on the leaves or grass:
in fact, there certainly could not have been any fire there!
The labourer was really frightened, and I cannot account for
my not having been so; but somehow the thing has made an
impression on my imagination. I never dream of it, nor think
of it in the dark, or anything: yet I am absolutely certain
of the facts, and wholly unable to account for them. Sometimes
I look on it as a half-miracle, of which the counterpart
is in store for us. The return of rough times may revive
energies that have been dormant “in the land of peace
wherein we trusted.” Is this nonsense?… I am very well,
all but my cough, which is exactly what it was, and is likely
to continue….’</p>

<p>This touch of mysticism, gracing a phosphoric phenomenon,
reminds one keenly of what Newman thought and expressed
about the whole Movement, if not of the men who seem to
us now ‘of unearthly radiance.’ ‘No mortal incendiary,’ he
said, in one of his splendid phrases already cited, ‘is at work.’</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="p2">To Newman, during this August, Hurrell pours out his
mind, with his usual forecasting irrelevance.</p>

<p>‘<span class="date"><abbr title="August">Aug.</abbr> 22.</span>&mdash;I have written a sermon on the duty of contemplating
a time when the law of the land shall cease to
be the law of the Church; and I hope to get it preached by
a friend of mine at the Bishop’s Visitation. My father thinks
it most temperate and satisfactory.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_151" id="fnanchor_151"></a><a href="#footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></span> If I had strong lungs I
should go about the country, holding forth.</p>

<p><!--150.png--><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pageno">122</span>
‘<span class="date"><abbr title="August">Aug.</abbr> 31.</span>&mdash;… It has lately come into my head that
the present state of things in England makes an opening for
reviving the monastic system. I think of putting the view
forward under the title of “Project for Reviving Religion in
Great Towns.” Certainly colleges of unmarried priests (who
might, of course, retire to a living, when they could and liked)
would be the cheapest possible way of providing effectively
for the spiritual wants of a large population…. I must go
about the country to look for the stray sheep of the true fold:
there are many about, I am sure; only that odious Protestantism
sticks in people’s gizzard. I see Hammond takes that
view of the Infallibility of the Church which P[almer] says
was the old one. We must revive it. Surely the promise,
“I am with you always,” means something?’</p>

<p>It is extraordinary how Hurrell’s talk runs not so much
on existing outer problems as on notions which ‘have lately
come into my head.’ The others were content to face
emergencies the moment they arose. He knew not how to
wait till things turned up: he went forward to turn them up.
His vocation was less to lead than to prompt the men born
to be leaders. The hard necessity of his lot, the denial to so
vigorous a spirit of the physical fuel to keep it alight, imposed
this upon him: to be what Emerson calls ‘the seeing eye, not
the helping hand.’ Yet his enforced contemplative life kept
those active brother lives together; he riveted their armour,
mounted their banners, and re-tipped their spears. It was his
destiny to give very much more than they could use, so
highly congested and quintessential were his ideas, and the
verbal hints born of them:</p>

<p class="unindent">He is the vision of a pilgrim entering from the Middle Ages,
barely laying down his staff and wallet before turning roadwards
again, yet managing to blurt out, irrespective of the
tavern conversation, fragments of his own correlated thought,
immemorial things which he, at least, seems never to have
forgotten. He is no opportunist, and chooses neither the
audience nor the hour. ‘What to assume and what to prove,’
<!--151.png--><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pageno">123</span>
as he says, do not sort themselves in his mind. He is only
oracular. He instructs Newman, in relation to no particular
topic whatever, but on a mere salutary general principle:
‘Do keep writing to Keble, and stirring his rage. He is
my fire, but I may be his poker.’ His influence over Keble’s
fearless intelligence, felt from the first, was ultimately very great.
His influence over Newman will hardly bear analysis, for
Newman and he were one: the gnomon and the disk of a dial,
or the arrow and the bow of some busy archer. We have
all seen just such influence as Froude, invalided, had upon
the Movement, privately exercised by Ministers of State, or by
wives with a ripe understanding of their husbands’ practical
concerns. It is the uncatalogued and intangible power, almost
a plaything to its possessor, least known among the powers
which move human society; and, therefore, perhaps it is the
grimmest reality of all.</p>

<p>On September 9, Newman burst forth with the famous
first sentence of his famous first Tract: ‘I am but one of
yourselves, a Presbyter.’ Hurrell wrote no comment on the
move; he was intimately aware of it from the beginning, and
the earliest and hungriest reader. By the 16th, he is deep in
study; there is a new historical theory to start, opening with
an ironic reference to Mr. Keble’s ‘friends’:</p>

<p>‘… I have been reading a good deal lately about your
friends the Puritans in Queen Elizabeth’s time; and really I
like poor Penry very much. I think of writing An Apology
for the Early Puritans, whose case I think to be this. The
Church of England had relinquished its claim to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus
divinum</i>, and considered Ordination to emanate ultimately
from the Queen. These poor fellows, <i>i.e.</i>, Penry and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>
(not Beza and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, nor Knox and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>), detested so abominable
a notion: but what could they do? They had been bred up
in a horror of trusting history in matters of religion, so they
could look for a divine institution and a priesthood nowhere
except in the Bible. Here, then, they looked, assuming as an
axiom that they must find; and finding nothing more reasonable
than the platform, they caught at this. In the meantime
our people, and the smug<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_152" id="fnanchor_152"></a><a href="#footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></span> fellows on the Continent, were
<!--152.png--><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pageno">124</span>
going on with their civilities to one another, and servilities to
their respective Governments, and left these poor men to fight
for a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus divinum</i>, though not the true one. It seems to me
that Saravia and Bancroft are the revivers of orthodoxy in
England, and that the Puritans shielded them from martyrdom.
Had it not been for their pertinacity in claiming a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus divinum</i>,
that tyrant<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_153" id="fnanchor_153"></a><a href="#footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></span> would certainly have smothered the true one.
Such are my crude speculations, on a rough survey: if you
think me hopelessly wrong, floor me at once, and save me
from wasting my time. How do you like my “Appointment
of the Bishops?”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_154" id="fnanchor_154"></a><a href="#footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></span> I have sent one on “State Interference
in Matters Spiritual,” very dry and matter-of-fact, and mean
to have a touch at the King’s supremacy, which I think
Hooker would not justify under present circumstances. I
think, if we manage well, we may make the idea of a Lay
Synod popular. Its members should be elected by universal
suffrage among the communicants, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">more primitivo</i>. I find
this view most effective in conversation. I am very well, and
don’t think of going abroad this winter, though you seem to
say I must. Time and money are two good things, and I
don’t like wasting more of them. I have done enough in that
line already…. I am quite surprised to see how much less
of a conservative [Rose?] is than he was six months since. I
do believe the progress of events is converting every one, and
that we shall not have much longer to encounter the stigma
of ultraism.’</p>

<p>Froude supplied, at most, but four of what George Eliot
called <cite>The Tracts Against the Times</cite>, if we are to count as his
only what he wrote out with his own hand. Of these, the
earliest, briefest, and most comprehensive is <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 8, The Gospel
a Law of Liberty, the authorship of which was, and is, frequently
assigned to Newman.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_155" id="fnanchor_155"></a><a href="#footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></span> It somewhat complicates matters
that in Newman’s printed correspondence are various remarks
addressed to him as responsible for <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 8, which bear no
<!--153.png--><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="pageno">125</span>
disclaimer in any note or parenthesis supplied by himself. It
is also noticeable that he writes to Hurrell on November 13,
1833: ‘Evangelicals, as I anticipated, are struck with The
Law of Liberty, and The Sin of the Church. The subject
of Discipline, too, I cannot doubt, will take them. Surely my
game lies among them.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_156" id="fnanchor_156"></a><a href="#footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></span> He might have said ‘our game,’
but he does not. Nor does The Gospel a Law of Liberty
appear in Froude’s <cite>Remains</cite>. Dean Burgon, however, prints in
the Appendix to his <cite>Twelve Good Men</cite> an extract from a
letter of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Charles Marriott to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> A. Burn of
Chichester, <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 29, 1840. ‘You ought to know,’ says that
gentle and unimpeachable authority, ‘that Froude was the
author of the Tract, The Gospel a Law of Liberty, which is
the subject of <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 8.’ Froude and Newman may well have
devised this <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 8 in concert. So far as the wording goes,
Newman’s light galloping touch is certainly upon it. In
idea it is intensely Froude-like in its concentrated suggestiveness:
in it we see the very pupa, as it were, of the
wide-winged theory of Dogmatic Development, broached at
Littlemore so long after. <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 8, with its <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">staccato marcato</i>
form, is perhaps the most typical of the early <cite>Tracts</cite>, and most
expressive of the spirit in which they were conceived. These
shared in common (in the opinion of Dr. Pusey’s conjoint
biographers, men who usually see things as they are) a ‘startling
and peremptory language.’ ‘First rouse,’ ran Hurrell’s
business-like programme, ‘then modify.’ Newman certainly,
in his office of rouser, availed to set gentle and simple by the
ears. Briefly, pungently, he did his inimitable work. Dr.
Pusey, with his serious grasp, his moral weight, his immense
learning, by contributing to the series his great signed Tract
on Baptism, changed the fashion as we know. To ‘modify’
began with him, and progressed with him. He had the
genius of explicit statement. It might even be said that
his whole influence and care, especially from 1845 on, were
on the side of expounding and applying, as Newman’s and
Froude’s had been preponderately on that of naked presentment,
full of novelty, excitement, and ‘danger.’ The little
guided Israel which had followed the pillar of fire by night,
<!--154.png--><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span class="pageno">126</span>
found it well, in due course, to follow the pillar of cloud by
day.</p>

<p>Froude’s other contributions to the <cite>Tracts</cite> were <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 9, On
Shortening the Church Services; <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 59, Church and State
(incorporated in the <cite>Remains</cite> as the concluding section of
State Interference in Matters Spiritual); and <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 63, on The
Antiquity of Existing Liturgies. The last-named was intended
to display the novel features of the Communion Service in the
Book of Common Prayer, as contrasted with those Uses having
inter-resemblance and an unbroken Apostolic derivation. It
is shown that every Ordo except the English contains a
memento of the dead; a sacrificial oblation; and a prayer ‘that
God may make the bread and wine the Body and Blood of
Christ.’ The method adopted by Froude in printing the
Forms of Consecration is that of the parallel column: an early
instance of the employment of that practical and sometimes
deadly modern device. He calls the Tract, elsewhere, ‘my
analysis of Palmer,’ and it was certainly fitted to concentrate
fresh attention on Mr. Palmer’s <cite>Origines Liturgicæ</cite>, as well as
on the norm of the matter it deals with.</p>

<p>Hurrell’s hands were full of writing in 1833; and being so
busied with larger matters, he ceased to compose and preach
sermons. Two very fine sombre ones, on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> John Baptist,
and Riches a Temptation, date from June of this year; but
they were his last. His true work lay in a less trodden field.
The strong essays signed ‘F.’ in <cite>The British Magazine</cite> are in
a happier vein than any of the sermons, and far more spontaneously
worded. Like Dr. Johnson, Hurrell had a writing
language, and a talking language which made faces at it.
The only papers of his which approach in animation the unconventional
utterances of his living voice and of all his
letters, are just those upon historic-ecclesiastical, not secular
subjects. There he sends up rockets too, though with a
certain resigned decorum, and would have filled the sky had
he not been curbed, as time went on, both by Rose and by
Newman.</p>

<p>He came up to Oriel on October 5. Newman, now in
the thick of affairs, and overjoyed to have him close at hand,
writes privately to Keble, whom it ‘grieved to the heart’: ‘I
<!--155.png--><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pageno">127</span>
fear that Calvert,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_157" id="fnanchor_157"></a><a href="#footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></span> whom you may recollect here, and a physician
now, has pronounced about Froude (not <em>to</em> him) a judgment
so unfavourable that I cannot bear to dwell upon it, or to tell
it. Pray exert your influence to get him sent to the West
Indies. I know he has a great prejudice against it; but,
still, what other place is hopeful? They say Madeira is not.
He might take a cargo of books with him. <em>N.B.</em>&mdash;Could you
not manage to send Isaac Williams too?’ On <abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 26,
Hurrell left Oxford for home, Keble going with him as far as
Bath. He sailed away on his second long voyage a month
later. During the interval, he takes up his tireless pen.</p>

<p class="p2">By early November the address of the clergy to the Archbishop
(Howley) of Canterbury, which covered much ground,
took many revisions, and ultimately was so well received, was
afoot. Hurrell was ready, with his own uncompromising
diction, to help it into being, leaving it to others to ‘supply
the etiquette about “the undersigned clergy, etc.”’ Rhetorical
drapery was hardly in his line. He sends to Newman some
pithy sentences about ‘the misapplication to which some of
the Services [of the Church of England] are exposed by the
practical disuse of the Rubrics prefixed to them, and the
inefficiency of attempting to act on these Rubrics without first
completing the ecclesiastical system they presuppose.’ Also,
he would have the reformers declare their conviction that
‘measures such as these, affecting the spiritual welfare of the
Church, ought to originate only with its spiritual rulers, and
that in such matters they deprecate every kind of extra-ecclesiastical
interference.’ ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Satis hæc lusisse</i>,’ he breaks off.
‘I am very well indeed;&mdash;not had so little cough as to-day
and yesterday, since the Lazaretto at Malta.’</p>

<p>So on <abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 4; and on the 14th, some affectionate abuse:
‘<ins title="Ageiôn och’ ariste">Ἀγείων ὄχ’ ἄριστε</ins>. Have you not been a spoon to allow
the Petition to have nothing about “the system presupposed
in the Rubrics,” and to leave out your key-words “completing”
and “extra-ecclesiastical”? The last word I would introduce
thus: “They take this opportunity of expressing their conviction
that the powers with which God has entrusted the spiritual
<!--157.png--><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pageno">129</span>
rulers of the Church are sufficient for its spiritual government,
and that all extra-ecclesiastical interference in its spiritual
concerns is both unnecessary and presumptuous.” My father
is annoyed at its being such milk-and-water. Do make a row
about it. I see already that I shall find in your book<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_161" id="fnanchor_161"></a><a href="#footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></span>
sentences which I am sure stood, when they were first written,
after some other sentence than that which affects to introduce
them now, and seem conscious of being in the neighbourhood of
a stranger: “buts” where there should have been “ands,” etc., of
which I shall make a catalogue, and pay you off for all the
workings you have given me before now. However, it looks very
pretty; and when I puff it, and people turn over the pages, they
have a very imposing effect. People say, “Ah! I dare say, a
very interesting work.”… Love and luck to all the Apostolicals.
Why do you say “yours <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">usque ad cineres</i>”? If I am
wrecked on Ash-Wednesday you will be the cause of it….’</p>

<p>‘My father’ was usually the bridle, not the spur, to his
young high-pacing ‘Apostolical.’ ‘I have often told Hurrell
he was going too fast,’ the Archdeacon writes a little later
to Newman. ‘He alarms people by his speculations, and is
incautious in talking to persons who cannot enter into the
purity of his motives. I dare say he laid himself completely
open on his visit to Archdeacon Lyall.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_162" id="fnanchor_162"></a><a href="#footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">Hurrell could not but enjoy his too quickly-ended months
at the Parsonage. However, he was never, even in full health,
very social, because having tested society, he feared the effect
of it upon himself. Much of it, he thought, would wake
in him pettiness of various sorts, and lead him to be ‘flash
and insincere,’ and tempt him also to value those who thought
him clever and charming, and to form ‘wild schemes about
becoming popular.’ But he ‘made himself agreeable,’ as it
is called, to please his father. He even rode to hounds, though
on principle he objected to hunting; and he put up generally,
<!--158.png--><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pageno">130</span>
without visible grimaces, with the customs, viands, amusements
and conversation of his class. He hated eccentricity, most
of all in himself, and very likely from his native fastidiousness,
as well as from the supernatural motive. Conscious idiosyncrasy
is so cheap! a deliberate escape from the vulgar being
essential vulgarity. ‘Any eccentric pleasure we have a fancy
for, particularly if we think it a proof of genius,’ had small
chances with Froude. His very difficult ideal, borrowed unconsciously
from <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Benedict and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard, was moderation,
the mean of things, the spiritual adornment of the ordinary.
He would attain to the ‘humdrum.’ ‘Whatever is disagreeable,’
he formulates to himself at twenty-three, ‘whatever, at
the same time, makes us like other people, is an opportunity
for self-denial,’ and through self-denial he meant, if possible, to
remodel Hurrell Froude. That was his fine art and his religion.
To ‘make a few saints,’ as he told his friend Rickards, was the
way for each man to build up Christianity again for all.</p>

<p>‘I have heard from dear Froude, who is certainly downcast,’
Newman confides to Keble towards the middle of this
month of November, in an undated letter. ‘He left home to-day,
and was to be with Canon Rogers till Saturday, when
the packet sails. He is full of disappointment at the address;
but then, say I, it effects two things: first, it addresses the
Archbishop as the head of the anti-innovators, and it addresses
him, and not the King or Parliament: which has a doctrinal
meaning, and is a good precedent. However, Froude calls me
names, and bids me stir you up into a fury, if I can.’</p>

<p>Newman’s thoughts continued to play pensively about his
friend ‘ordered South.’ He reverts to him, without naming
him, on the 22nd, when he writes to Mr. Rickards, in reply
to a letter of censure: ‘Nor can I wish anyone a happier lot
than to be himself unfortunate, yet to urge on a triumphant
cause: like Laud and Ken in their day, who left a name
which after ages censure or pity, but whose works do follow
them. Let it be the lot of those I love to live in the heart
of one or two in each succeeding generation, or to be altogether
forgotten, while they have helped forward the Truth.’</p>

<p class="p2">Hurrell put to sea, again from Falmouth, this time without
<!--159.png--><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pageno">131</span>
Newman or his father. ‘Blowing a full gale … and I to start
to-morrow morning!’ And, by way of hygienic consolation:
‘A sailing vessel is as nearly the cleanest thing in the world
as a steamer is the dirtiest.’</p>

<p>Mr. Keble, who may have chiefly influenced his decision
to go to Barbados, would be intimately interested, for a dozen
reasons, to hear of Hurrell’s welfare in a field where he himself
might once have found his lifework. As long before as 1824,
he had been offered the Archdeaconry of Barbados (worth
£2000 a year), and declined his only ecclesiastical dignity, as
he declined or accepted pretty much everything, for a pious
domestic reason: his father was too infirm.</p>

<p>‘With hands bitten sore by mosquitoes, I set to, upon a
sheet of paper which will witness many fresh bites before I
get through it. The wretches are flitting about me on all
sides, and every moment I am forced to put down my pen and
hit at them. People soon cease to care for them: that is my
only consolation. The weather here is most delicious, the
thermometer averaging eighty-three degrees, and showers
flying in all directions. When it rains here, they say:
“What a fine day!”… The room I am in has seven
windows and four doors, with a thorough draught every way;
everything is contrived for getting up thorough draughts:
long passages open at both ends, for the everlasting east wind
to blow through, and windows on every side of a room where
it is possible, or immense doors opposite them, where it is not.
I suppose before the hurricane<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_163" id="fnanchor_163"></a><a href="#footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></span> this must have been a house
fit for a resident gentleman of high pretensions; now it consists
only of two rooms, and a number of sheds erected round
them against the walls that remain standing…. The sum
which was set aside by Government to repair the injury done
here is not allowed to go to the repair of Churches, even
though 24,000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> of it is still in hand, which they do not know
how to dispose of, and seven Churches are in complete ruins….</p>

<p>‘I have heard some facts which seem to show a good spirit
among the clergy…. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, about whom you may remember
<!--160.png--><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pageno">132</span>
the great row that took place some years since for
admitting a black to the Communion in company with whites,
has now so completely broken down that feeling, that last
Sunday, when I received the Sacrament at his Church, at
which near two hundred people were present, all colours were
mixed indiscriminately. In the Roman Catholic islands this
was always insisted on, and carried with a high hand….
This island is very green, and its plants very exotic-looking,
but there is a total want of beauty. For all I have yet seen,
the coasts of the Mediterranean are the places “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mortalibus ægris
munere concessæ Divom</i>.” Also, the negro features are so
horridly ugly, at least the generality of them: now and then
indeed one sees finely-chiselled Egyptian features, and among
the others one can distinctly trace the difference of caste in all
shades from man to monkey…. You will be shocked at
my avowal, that I am every day becoming a less and less loyal
son of the Reformation. It appears to me plain that in all
matters that seem to us indifferent or even doubtful, we should
conform our practices to those of the Church which has
preserved its traditionary practices unbroken. We cannot
know about any seemingly indifferent practice of the Church
of Rome that it is not a development of the Apostolic <ins title="êthos">ἦθος</ins>; and
it is to no purpose to say that we can find no proof of it in the
writings of the six first centuries; they must find a <em>dis</em>proof if
they would do anything…. I have been reading the controversy
between Law and Hoadly for the first time. Law’s
brilliance quite astonished me: I think it the most striking
specimen of writing I ever saw. Yet I own now and then he
seems rather wild. Surely one could get such splendid compositions
into circulation by puffing them? It was a noble
end of Convocation to be put down for censuring Hoadly, and
the censure looks well as the last record in Wilkins’s <cite>Concilia</cite>.
The sun that set so bright must have a rising!… I have
translated all the Becket correspondence, and should go [on]
at once to Anselm, if I was not on the point of starting with the
Bishop<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_164" id="fnanchor_164"></a><a href="#footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></span> on his Visitation. All I hear makes me wish to go
<!--161.png--><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pageno">133</span>
to America, though I do not conceive the views of the clergy
in general there to be very high. Preaching goes for everything,
and a person that cannot fill his Church gets dismissed.
I think that in the present state of religion preaching should
be quite disconnected from the Services, and looked on as an
address to the unconverted.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_165" id="fnanchor_165"></a><a href="#footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></span>… We ought to employ
itinerant talkers in England; I am sure I could stir up people
very much in Devonshire and Cornwall in that way.’</p>

<p>‘… I have a very poor account to give you of my studies.
I have been here near a month, and have not set to work
regularly on anything. Although I have not done anything
like regular work, I have picked up a good deal. I have been
looking about, here and there…. Does not the Archbishop
of Canterbury claim patriarchal authority (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qualem qualem</i>) over
as large a portion of the globe as ever the Bishop of Rome
did? and are not the Colonial Bishops just as much exonerated
from their oath of canonical obedience, by proving that there
is no universal Bishop recognised in Scripture, as ever Cranmer
was?… I have been much surprised to find that the first
Latitudinarians were Tories: <i>e.g.</i>, Hales, Chillingworth, and
that set. How Whiggery has by degrees taken up all the filth
that has been secreted in the fermentation of human thought!
Puritanism, Latitudinarianism, Popery, Infidelity; they have it
all now, and good luck to them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_166" id="fnanchor_166"></a><a href="#footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></span> I see the reason Convocation
was put down in 1717 was the remonstrance of the Lower
House against the Upper, to make them censure Hoadly’s
<cite>Preservative</cite>. The Upper House had a very little while before
taken part with the Socinianising Bishops against the Lower.
Also, what a curious thing it is to see the popularity of High
Churchism among the lower orders at the time of Sacheverell’s
trial! These matters have opened to my weak mind a field
of thought and inquiry which I have no great chance of following
<!--162.png--><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pageno">134</span>
up. If I had 5000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>, I would pay all the clever fellows I
could find to analyse the pamphlets, etc., of that time, and make
a good History of Protestantism. A continuation of Collier<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_167" id="fnanchor_167"></a><a href="#footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></span>
would just take in all I desiderate, and if done well, most
curious and amusing it would be…. The most sensible
people here seem to think it certain, that, after the emancipation
of the slaves, no estate will be profitable enough to pay for a
manager, so that all English proprietors who from age or habit,
etc., are not able to come out and reside on their own property,
must sell at a reduced price; also that since this climate, state
of society, etc., suits the coloured people better than the whites,
it will answer to them to buy at a higher rate than others, so
that the islands will by degrees become what they call “brown”
islands, and relapse into a semi-savage state by the gradual
withdrawal of those who now keep up the tone of acquirement,
etc.; that this will happen without any bloodshed, but will
destroy the commercial value of the islands, for that not more
than one-fifth of the sugar will be grown, and the rest of the
land employed in growing sustenance for the idle population.’</p>

<p class="p2 center">To the <abbr title="Venerable">Ven.</abbr> Archdeacon <span class="smcap">Froude</span>, <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 6, 1834.</p>

<p>‘… The weather has been very boisterous since I have been
here: people say that they should have called the night of
Friday 17th [January] a hurricane, if it had been in August or
September…. I don’t know whether I may lay any blame on
the weather, but certainly my cough has made no progress for
the better since I landed. I don’t mean that I am worse, for
I certainly have gained flesh, but my cough is exactly where
it was when I first got into the warm latitudes: an improvement
on what it was in England, but no more. The temperature
of the air is quite delightful, but there is nothing to interest
one out-of-doors: horridly ugly faces, most uninteresting
scenery, an extremely shabby town, the population of which
may, in point of morals, be called almost the sink of humanity;
and then the vulgar names of all the places (I forget them
as fast as I hear them), and money-making associations, which
intrude into everything one sees and hears, offer a sad contrast
<!--163.png--><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pageno">135</span>
to last winter’s work. But I don’t mention this out of
grumbling, only as a reason why I am not more out-of-doors:
the fact is, I spend my time in-doors very agreeably indeed.
The Bishop stands very high in my estimation as a man of
imperturbable equanimity among great trials to his temper, and
the footing on which all his clergy are with him is a model.…
The Bishop’s library is capital&mdash;much better than I expected;
and as the daily expectation of setting off on the
Visitation has kept me from going to work on anything
regular, I have been dipping about, to my great amusement.…
They say that if the growth of sugar were discontinued
the island would produce sustenance enough for a very much
larger population, almost without any cultivation. The
vegetation is really wonderful. The guinea corn grows near
fifteen feet high: and in the sugar crop there seems to be a
mass of solid vegetable matter thrown up, as much as there is
in a copse of ten years’ growth. It is an impenetrable thicket
of rank iris: the cane part is just like the knotty root of an
iris straightened out, and rising six or seven feet out of the
ground; its colour is the richest yellow-green that can be
conceived.</p>

<p>‘<span class="date"><abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 6.</span>&mdash;At anchor off Nevis,&mdash;between it and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Christopher’s, which the Protestants have vulgarised into
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kitt’s. The Bishop is ashore confirming, and I have
stayed to fetch up leeway. Since Monday, <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 26, when
we started on our voyage, I have been in quite a new state
of things…. I have a very uncomfortable hot, dark berth,
which I could go into amusing details about, if it was
worth the trouble; but “beggars must not be choosers,” as
they say, so I may think myself well off to have any berth
at all. The first place we got to was Antigua. About
seven in the morning I came on deck, and found we were
close to it: quite unlike Barbados; it put me in mind of
Ithaca, or bits of the Sicilian coast: very beautiful, but on
a small scale. While we stood off and on before what
seemed an iron-bound coast, a pilot-boat emerged from one-could-not-say-where;
and when the pilot was on board, we
tacked, and sailed straight against a rock. As we got quite
close, it began to appear that the shore was not a continuous
<!--164.png--><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pageno">136</span>
line, but that one rock overlapped another, and between these
there turned out to be an entrance about a gun-shot wide,
which took us into a beautiful little lake, where there was
just room to anchor. You will find it in the map, under
the name English Harbour. And now I will not go on
bothering with descriptions. We landed at the dockyard,
where a file of soldiers were drawn up in compliment to the
Bishop, and as he stepped out of the boat the batteries
saluted. That part of Antigua is exquisitely beautiful;
very deep bays and rocks, and pasture and wood and
mountains, put the sugar and the niggers quite out of one’s
head. The people seem a superior set to what you have
elsewhere. I liked some of the clergy much, and the
resident proprietors are said to be, with some exceptions,
intelligent gentlemen…. We were at Antigua six days;
since that we have been at Montserrat and Nevis, both
mountainous on a large scale, and generally lost in cloud.
Nevis is not unlike Pantelaria. Yesterday we dined at the
President’s,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_168" id="fnanchor_168"></a><a href="#footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></span> and had turtle for the first time.</p>

<p>‘Here I am with the Bishop on his Visitation, so that
I have the advantage of a good long sea-voyage and some
variety of scenery, both [of] which are good for me, though I
cannot say they have as yet produced any perceptible effect.
I seem to be just as well and no better than I was last
summer; in fact, this is nothing else than a protracted
summer, and it is unreasonable to expect more from climate
here than from the same climate in England. You will see
in my letter to [Newman] how I have employed my time in
Barbados, and the length that I am being pulled on in anti-Protestantism.
Would not Hammond, and Fell, and the
rest of those holy humble men of God have altered the

‘… [Rose?] seems to think anything better than an open
rupture with the State, as sure to entail loss of caste on the
clergy. Few men can receive the saying that the clergy have
no need to be gentlemen….</p>

<p>‘… We have just left <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Christopher’s; it is the
most beautiful of any of the islands I have yet seen. Mount
Miserere is quite fine; a precipitous granite crag, quite bare,
and of a very great height, rising out of the rich woods with
which the mountain is clothed up to the top, and stooping
over a very deep hollow, which has once been the crater of
a volcano. I should have liked much to get up there, but
had not time, and besides, they say it is very difficult. The
people here seem to have very little curiosity: in fact, few
tastes except acquisitiveness…. I see the papers have
begun to talk; addresses to the Archbishop are said to be
pouring in. I wish I could get my lungs right again to
make preachments, and give the Yanks a talking over. We
shall be back at Barbados the second week in March, and
about then the weather in New York brightens up. I think
I have made up my mind not to be in England till
the latter end of May, whatever news we have, so I shall
certainly have time on my hands, and if I can’t preach I
can prose; so I may as well go at any rate. Do ply the
people with Tracts on the “safest course” principle: the
more I think of it, the more important it seems as the
intellectual basis of Church authority…. We have now
got a north-west wind, which a few years since would have
been almost a miracle in these latitudes. It is generally
said that the trade-winds are becoming yearly more irregular,
and have been for this last fifty years. It will make a
curious change if they cease altogether; certainly nothing
can be more irregular than we have had them, both in
quantity and direction; it goes from a storm to a calm in
no time, and the other night went all round the compass.
This puts me in mind of an adventure we had the other
evening at Nevis. There is no harbour there, but only a
beach to land on, and sometimes a heavy surf. We landed
in the morning, in still weather. In the course of the day
it came to blow on shore, and we had to embark in the dark,
<!--166.png--><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pageno">138</span>
in a very heavy sea breaking on the sands most furiously.
The Bishop slept on shore, but the Commodore, the Captain,
the Chaplain, and myself were carried on men’s shoulders
to the boat, which was lying as near the shore as it could,
in the midst of the breakers. I was put in second, and
was only wetted by the water in the bottom of the boat,
but the two last were fairly soused…. I am sure this
stuff is not worth sending across the Atlantic.’</p>

<p class="p2 center">To <span class="smcap">William Froude</span>, <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 12, 1834.</p>

<p>‘… I will try to scrape together stuff for a letter to
you. We are becalmed with Saba off our starboard quarter,
in the <span class="shipname">Forte</span> frigate, forty-six guns, Commodore P….
Somehow, this frigate is beyond my comprehension. I am
not up to taking an interest in its movements; it is 1150
tons and the sails are so large, and the masts so high, and
such an immense lot of ropes, that I see no hope of learning
anything about it. When they get up the anchor they have
100 men at the capstan, and if they want to tack quickly
they put 300 men to work at once. They do their work
to the sound of two fiddles and a fife, instead of the gibber
that one is accustomed to in the <span class="shipname">Ranger</span> and elsewhere; so,
as the [Provost?] would say, “I don’t comprehend the style of
things.” The day before yesterday we had two adventures.
(1) A man was to be flogged, and as I knew that he would
be let off out of compliment to the Bishop, I went on deck
to see the preliminary ceremony. The whole ship’s crew
were mustered, while the fellow stood under guard; then a
grating was lashed to the gangway, and his wrists and
ankles made fast to it, his jacket having been stripped off
in readiness; the officers stood in full dress on one side of
him, and the boatswain’s mates on the other; and the
Commodore read over the articles of war. I watched the
fellow’s countenance closely. At first he seemed very unconcerned,
but the ceremony seemed by degrees to work on
his imagination, and just before his pardon was announced
he seemed in considerable dismay. The thing has stuck in
my mind deeper than I expected, and I feel rather sick at
thinking of it. The officers say that letting him off did
<!--167.png--><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pageno">139</span>
a great deal of harm. Last night ever such a lot were
drunk, and I suppose they will catch it in a day or two!
Twenty-four hours must elapse between the offence and the
punishment. (2) The other adventure was falling in with
a man-of-war by night, so that we could not distinguish each
other’s colours. On nearing them we heard them pipe to
quarters, and on coming up we found them, contrary to
etiquette, with their main-deck lighted up, their guns and
rigging manned, and with every demonstration of readiness
for action; so we had to make similar preparations with all
speed: powder was got up, and both sides loaded and
shotted, exactly as if we intended to fight. On passing
them the Commodore asked what they were, and they would
not tell, and nothing more came of it: a beautiful mare’s
nest. The officers say it was a Dutch frigate, and that
since our ill behaviour to them they have made a point of
showing our ships disrespect; however, if a gun had gone
off by accident, which might easily have been, as they all
have flint and steel locks, it would have ended in a fight,
most likely…. From <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas’s we go to Santa Cruz,
and from thence to La Guayra, so I shall have a fine cruise
altogether; yet somehow I take no interest in the places I
see: there is something so unromantic among the English,
and so unpleasing about the niggers, that they spoil the
scenery altogether. The thing that strikes me as most
remarkable in the cut of these niggers is excessive immodesty;
a forward, stupid familiarity, intended for civility,
which prejudices me against them worse even than Buxton’s<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_170" id="fnanchor_170"></a><a href="#footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></span>
cant did…. I want much to hear about your steam-engine….
I begin to think that the Nonjurors were the
last of English divines, and that those since are twaddlers.
The more I read, the more I am reconciled to the present
state of things in England, and prospects of the Church. It
seems to be only the fermentation of filth which has long
been in existence, and could not be got rid of otherwise….
And now my ideas run slow, and take more trouble writing

<p class="p2 center">To the <abbr title="Venerable">Ven.</abbr> Archdeacon <span class="smcap">Froude</span>, April 2, 1834.</p>

<p>‘… We left the island [Santa Cruz] at four o’clock on
Thursday, the Bishop having been conveyed to Fredericstadt
in the Governor’s carriage and four, escorted by an aide-de-camp,
and embarking under a salute. We were under weigh
in about an hour, with a breeze east-north-east. On Saturday
evening we saw, like a pale blue mist rising above the clouds, the
outline of the South American mountains. The next morning,
when I came on deck, we were within nine miles of the coast,
and the gigantic features of the scenery produced the same
effect that we observed between Salerno and Amalfi, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, of
making distant objects seem so near each other. The
mountains rose boldly out of the sea, as far as the eye could
reach before us and behind us, as we sailed along the
coast. Their height varies from 5000 to 9000 feet. One of
them (the highest) is a perpendicular precipice for 8000 feet:
Humboldt describes it as the most remarkable precipice in the
world. However, the effect, as a whole, cannot be compared
to that of the Italian or Sicilian coast. The mountains are
richly covered with wood from the very bottom to the top,
except the peaks of the very highest, which are naked granite,
but so high that the rocky features, when diminished by the
great distance and rendered indistinct by the haze of the hot
air, lose all their raciness; so that there is no variety of colour,
but a mass of uniform green, or rather gray, more or less pale
according to the distance. We coasted along about twelve
miles almost under the shadow of the rocks, yet near nine
miles from them. Early in the morning they were visible from
top to bottom, but indistinct from the dazzle of the sun, which
was behind them. About ten o’clock a line of little misty dots
formed at a uniform height above the sea, perhaps 3000 feet.
This became denser and denser, till it became one impenetrable
cloud, above which we could see nothing. About twelve we
anchored at La Guayra, which Humboldt says is the hottest
place in the world. The thermometer in the cabin window
<!--169.png--><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="pageno">141</span>
was ninety degrees. The Bishop and Commodore disembarked
that evening and rode over the mountains to Caraccas; I and
some of the officers were to follow before daylight. Accordingly,
having ordered mules over-night, we got up at half-past
three, breakfasted on board, and set out for the shore, two
boat-loads. There was a very heavy rolling swell, and the
landing-place is a wooden stage upon piles, which does not
keep off the sea at all. We lay by anxiously waiting for a
lull, and all of us in the first boat succeeded in landing dry on
the stage, and running off before a wave had time to reach us;
but when the second boat was lying on its oars, in hopes of a
lull like ours, a wave far above the size of the rest broke just
ahead of them; and really, I never saw such a nervous sight!
The boat, in which were ten rowers and several officers,
seemed to stand quite upright on its stern, so as to leave us
doubtful which way it would fall. The whole was hid for a
moment in a mass of spray, except that we could see the blades
of the oars sticking out, all in confusion, as the water took
them. When the wave passed and the boat righted, they say
it was full up to the thwarts. On seeing this Captain H.
ordered them to pull off, and sent a shore boat for them, i.e.,
two niggers in a canoe, which took them out one or two at a
time. The last load consisted of the Commodore’s steward, an
old Italian for whom I have an affection, and a midshipman.
As they were alongside the stage a wave broke outside them;
the mid was lucky enough to catch hold in time, but the poor
Italian, canoe, niggers, and all, totally disappeared, and were
seen again about thirty yards off progressing with the crest
of the wave towards the beach, on which all were deposited
safe, after a dive of near 600 yards. <em>N.B.</em>&mdash;The niggers and
Spaniards, when landing themselves, never think of going to
the stage, but sitting very steadily in their canoes, wait where
the waves begin to break, and only taking care to keep the
boat straight, and paddling a little to assist it in getting way
at first, they are shot in without any effort, on the crest of
the wave, with wonderful velocity, keeping on the downhill
side of it all the time, and at last are deposited high and dry.
When I saw this first, I could hardly believe my eyes.</p>

<p>‘I shall stay here a fortnight longer at least, and then set
<!--170.png--><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="pageno">142</span>
off for New York. I am very grateful for your long letters,
which come by every packet.’</p>

<p class="p2">There follows a letter on April 8, 1834, conjointly
addressed:</p>

<p>‘Joannibus Keble et Newman: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fratres ignavissimi, ut
quid fecisti nobis sic</i>? as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas says to the Bishop of
Poictiers…. The Bishop [of Barbados] is a thorough Z;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_172" id="fnanchor_172"></a><a href="#footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></span> and
I can make no impression on him, though I think I have
frightened him. If he had not been as kind to me as one
man can be to another, I should be terribly provoked with
him sometimes…. You may like to know of my health:
I really think I am getting well. I left England in the
impression that I was <ins title="minynthadios">μινυνθάδιος</ins>, as you may see in a
scratched-out passage in one of my letters; since I have
conceived hopes, I have become much more careful. I should
not wonder, if I stayed here, till<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_173" id="fnanchor_173"></a><a href="#footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></span> I get quite rid of my cough.
The Bishop’s library is a great piece of luck. I don’t think
I am wasting my time here, independent of my health. I
don’t ask how anyone is, for I shall certainly be gone
before I can have an answer; and when I shall go to
Yankland I do not know…. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Valete, et confortamini in

<p>‘… As to Froude, I know, of course, no more than the
letters have told us both, and the first was so flattering that
I was disappointed at the other; yet, on consideration, I see
no additional reason for alarm. It seems much as it used to
be, and we cannot be wrong in hoping the best. Anyone who
remembers him three or four years ago must acknowledge that
to have him now is much more than we could have been sure
about. I wish him strong enough, please God, to take duty
and wait on some flock. I think he would get more calm
and less young in his notions, or rather in his way of putting
them, which makes people who do not know him think him
<!--171.png--><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pageno">143</span>
not a practical man. What a wise old<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_174" id="fnanchor_174"></a><a href="#footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></span> letter! Well, good-bye.’</p>

<p class="p2">On May 2, Hurrell makes to Mr. Keble the frank confession
that he is not well enough to return to England, or to
travel at all. He never saw the United States. He adds,
referring to clauses in the Oriel Statutes, which he seems to
have known by heart, ‘Try to satisfy the College that though
my <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ægritudo</i> is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diutina</i>, it may not be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">incurabilis</i>.’ And he
goes on to say that a mathematical instructor is wanted
at Codrington College,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_175" id="fnanchor_175"></a><a href="#footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></span> ‘so I mean to offer myself, on condition
of having a room given me, and being allowed to
battel.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_176" id="fnanchor_176"></a><a href="#footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></span> Mind, this is mere castle-building as yet, but it is
ten to one it will be realised. In fact, unless I get suddenly
and decidedly well before the end of this month, I see no chance
against it; so will your worships have the goodness to get
together a few sets of the [Oxford] Tracts; also three or four
copies of a work<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_177" id="fnanchor_177"></a><a href="#footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></span> which I see much praised in <cite>The British
Magazine</cite>, as coming from the pen of “a scholar, a man of
refined taste, and above all, a Christian”; also a copy of an
anonymous work called <cite>The Christian Year</cite>, which I forgot to
bring with me; also the parts <cite>Autumnalis</cite> and <cite>Hyemalis</cite> of
my Breviary; also any newspapers or reviews, or anything
else which will throw light on your worships’ proceedings; and
send the package to [my father]: let it be a good big one;
and mind to send lots of Tracts, for I shall try hard to poison
the minds of the natives out here…. There is a most commendable
<!--172.png--><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pageno">144</span>
production in the supplemental December number,
signed C.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_178" id="fnanchor_178"></a><a href="#footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></span> Whose is it? he should be cultivated. I should
like to see a good one on clergy praying with their faces to
the Altar and backs to the congregation. In a Protestant
Church the parson seems either to be preaching the prayers
or worshipping the congregation…. The climate out here
is certainly delicious, though it alters one’s metaphors a little:
<i>e.g.</i>, the shady side of the hedge would be the cheerful one.
The only nuisance is that everything is so inelegant: money
and luxury are the people’s sole objects, and their luxuries are
only of the kind that can be enjoyed on the instant: no one
counts on living here, so there are no porticos, no fountains,
no avenues, nothing that makes the south of Europe such a
fairyland. Windmills and boiling-houses, treeless fields and
gardenless houses, are the only things one sees; except at my
dreamed-of residence, Codrington College, where there is a
grand avenue of gigantic palms,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_179" id="fnanchor_179"></a><a href="#footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></span> a delicious spring of the
freshest (nothing is cold here) clearest water, and a very
tolerably nice flower-garden with mowed turf, and roses that
smell, and almost complete seclusion. If I go there I shall
turn sentimental, and sit <ins title="para thina thalassês atrygetoio dakrycheôn">παρὰ θῖνα θαλάσσης ἀτρυγέτοιο δακρυχέων</ins>.
I wish I could be in England now, and see a
little of “Nature’s tenderest, freshest green,” etc. Out here
it is the leafless time….’</p>

<p>One circumstance which would turn Hurrell’s thoughts the
more readily to a tutorship was that he could no longer be
domestic Chaplain. The Bishop of Barbados had gone on a
long visit to England.</p>

<p class="p2">Beginning in June of this year, and lasting into October,
appeared in <cite>The British Magazine</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_180" id="fnanchor_180"></a><a href="#footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></span> copious excerpts from the
ancient Parish Books of Dartington. There is a very high
value put now upon all such publications, and a very general
<!--173.png--><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="pageno">145</span>
interest in them; but one wonders how many readers of the
time, brought up on controversy, begrudged the space given
to the statistics of bygone village people. Archdeacon Froude
sent up copies of his registers to London, in response to the
behest of that busy antiquary in the making, his eldest son:
that seems an obviously safe deduction.</p>

<p>Newman has something to say to the absentee on June 15.</p>

<p>‘Was it not a strange mishap, that much as you abused
me for making you a cat’s paw, yet when the time of danger
came, you should get out of the way, and leave innocent me to
trouble? So it was: only think how mildly I have always
spoken of Arnold, and how bitterly you! Never did I use a
harsh word against him, I think, except that once, and then at
Rome, and with but one or two friends.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_181" id="fnanchor_181"></a><a href="#footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></span> Yet even from Rome
those few words are dragged forth, and I have to answer for
them…. In the next place, my <cite>Tracts</cite> are abused as Popish;
as for other things, so especially for expressions about the
Eucharist. Here, as you well know, it was you who were apt
to be unguarded, not I. I could tell you much, only it is
renewing sorrows, and nothing else, of the plague the <cite>Tracts</cite>
have been to us, and how we have removed them to Rivington’s.
That the said <cite>Tracts</cite> have been of essential benefit it is
impossible to doubt. Pamphlets, sermons, etc. on the Apostolic
Succession are appearing in every part of the kingdom….
H[enry] Wilberforce engaged to marry Miss S[argent] last
December, was afraid to tell me, and left Oxford without;
spread abroad I had cut R[yder]<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_182" id="fnanchor_182"></a><a href="#footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></span> for marrying. Yet he has
not ratted,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_183" id="fnanchor_183"></a><a href="#footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></span> and will not: so be it. Marriage, when a crime, is
a crime which it is criminal to repent of.’</p>

<p>Poor Henry Wilberforce, caught red-handed, did not repent.
<!--174.png--><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pageno">146</span>
He had poured forth various misgivings in the ear of the ever
sympathetic Rogers. ‘Indeed, though I did not tell Neander
(as who would?) yet I did tell his sister, and gave her leave to
tell him…. I suppose, however, he will cut me. I cannot
help it. At any rate, you must not…. Nor again, am I without
a feeling of the danger, as you know, of married priests in
these days of trouble and rebuke; but I have taken my line.’</p>

<p>‘It is needless to say,’ adds Miss Mozley in her narrative
notes, ‘that “Neander” did not “cut” the writer of this letter,
whose firstborn was subsequently his godson.’</p>

<p>But to return to Newman’s letter to Froude, which goes on:</p>

<p>‘I have long come to the conclusion that our time is not
come, <i>i.e.</i>, that other persons can do the day’s work as well as,
or better than we can, our business being only to give them a
shove now and then. You send home flaming papers, but, after
all, I fall back to what I said last year on your articles about
the Præmunire. Not that it is not right, very right, to
accustom men’s imaginations to the prospect of changes; but
they cannot realise the arguments: they are quite beyond
them…. This is our gain, and I intend to make use of it….
Meanwhile let us read, and prepare ourselves for better
things…. As to Rose, he is a fine fellow, certainly he is, and
complains that he has no one, all through London, in whom he
can confide. O that you were well enough to assist him in
London! You are not fit to move of yourself, but you would
act through Rose as spirit acts on external matter through a
body. He has everything which you are without, and is so
inflammable that not even muscles are more sensitive of volition
than he would be of you.’</p>

<p>The ‘flaming papers,’ as Newman calls them, were the
disconnected, wide-branching chapters dealing with various
aspects of Rationalism in relation to doctrine, composed entirely
at Barbados during 1834, and pieced together and published
in 1839 from four incomplete manuscripts. Fragmentary as
they are, they would, under careful editing, and coupled with
the <cite>State Interference</cite> and <cite>Church Discipline</cite>, display Froude’s
tangential and remorseless intelligence at its very best.</p>

<p>The proposed conjunction of Froude with Rose was less
than a dream: a flat impossibility. It is wonderful that
<!--175.png--><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><span class="pageno">147</span>
Newman, who loved Rose truly in a measure, should never
have quite sounded the reasons why he and Froude were not
in closer accord and amity. When they were both in their
untimely graves, Newman associated their memories as fellow-workers
of the Will of God, in his comforting letter to Mr.
Rose’s widow. But the two, clearly, were temperamental
antipodes, partners in nothing but their stainless zeal, and their
uncomplaining battle with long disease.</p>

<p class="p2">Once settled as instructor of mathematics to his young
theologians, Hurrell pays epistolary dues to his father, and
offers some ghostly counsel of a then drastic kind.</p>

<p class="p2 center">To the <abbr title="Venerable">Ven.</abbr> Archdeacon <span class="smcap">Froude</span>, August 22, 1834.</p>

<p>‘… I am now at Codrington College, where Mr. P[inder]<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_184" id="fnanchor_184"></a><a href="#footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></span>
the Principal, and his wife, have made me very comfortable
indeed. I am quite ashamed to think how much trouble they
have taken. I have two rooms about thirteen by fourteen each,
twelve high; the sitting room looks out on the Atlantic, which
is about half a mile off at the bottom of a very steep hill to
which the Babbacombe<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_185" id="fnanchor_185"></a><a href="#footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></span> one is nothing. The view is very pretty:
the foreground is the Principal’s garden, which is the most
English thing in the West Indies, they say: then comes some
very rough uncultivated ground, some part of which is quite
parkish; and at the bottom a beautiful little bay which just
now, while the wind is south, is as still as a millpond.</p>

<p>‘I give two Lectures a day, which is an amusement, and
helps me to avoid thinking, which is ruination, I am sure.
Some of the youngsters are very stupid, some passable, and
one rather clever; so that the work is not monotonous. I
have commons from the College kitchen very comfortably, and
since I have had the ordering of my own dinner, I have
entirely left off animal food. My dinner is a sort of slimy
vegetable, the name of which I forget, but which tastes something
like an oyster; and custard pudding, and a tumbler of
water. At breakfast I eat two eggs, and put lots of butter
<!--176.png--><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pageno">148</span>
to my bread; it is only lately that I have got over my dislike
to Barbados butter. The first hour after daylight, I work
myself with dumb-bells, which is very dull, but they say a good
thing; and washing afterwards is a great treat. Also I sometimes
undress in the middle of the day, and have a bout at the
same dull occupation to get an appetite for dinner; and about
half-past five in the evening I get an hour’s walk: so I am
doing all I can for myself if nature will but help me, and if my
patience will hold out. The disheartening thing is, that if I
ate a beefsteak and drank a bottle of porter and six glasses of
wine a day, I don’t believe my pulse would rise or my cough
increase an atom. However, I hope to give this abstemious
plan a fair trial; for unless it weakens me, which I have not
yet found, it can do no harm.</p>

<p>‘I wish you did not set your face so pertinaciously against
any alteration in the mode of appointing Bishops; that is the
real seat of the disorder of the Church: the more I think of it,
the more sure I am that unless something is done about it,
there must be a separation in the Church before long, and that
I shall be one of the separatists. It will not do to say that
you see great evils in any proposed new plan: that is a very
good argument when the present state of things is good; but
when a man is dying, it is poor wisdom in him to object that
the plans the surgeons propose for his relief are painful and
dangerous. There is another reform, which I have been
thinking of lately more than I did before, though I have long
thought something should be done about it; and it is one
which every clergyman can make for himself without difficulty.
I believe it to be the most indispensable of all the duties of
external religion, that every one should receive the Communion
as often as he has opportunity; and that if he has such
opportunity every day of the week, it is his duty to take
advantage of it every day of the week. And further, as an
immediate corollary from this, I think it the duty of every
clergyman to give the serious members of his congregation this
opportunity as often as he can without neglecting other parts
of his duty. Now at [Dartington] if you had the Communion
every Sunday you might make sure of a sufficient number of
communicants: and I don’t know of any other duty that you
<!--177.png--><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pageno">149</span>
would have to neglect in consequence. Or, at any rate, you
might have it every month without the slightest difficulty, and
need assign no reason for the change; indeed, people would
not find out at first that there was any change. I wish you
would turn this over in your mind. I dare say you will think
my view overstrained, and very likely it may be a little. Yet
the more I think of it, the less doubtful it seems to me. I
know that neither N[ewman]<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_186" id="fnanchor_186"></a><a href="#footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></span> nor K[eble], when I left England,
saw the thing in the light in which it now strikes me; they
thought that it was desirable to have the Communion as often
as possible, but still that the customs of particular places ought
not to be changed without particular reason. But it really
does seem to me that the Church of England has gone so very
wrong in this matter, that it is not right to keep things smooth
any longer. The administration of the Communion is one of the
very few religious duties now performed by the clergy for which
Ordination has ever been considered necessary. Preaching,
and reading the Scriptures, is what a layman can do as well as
a clergyman. And it is no wonder the people should forget
the difference between ordained and unordained persons, when
those who are ordained do nothing for them but what they
could have done just as well without Ordination! If you are
determined to have a pulpit in your Church, which I would
much rather be without, do put it at the west end of the
Church, or leave it where it is: every one can hear you
perfectly; and what can they want more? But whatever
you do, pray don’t let it stand in the light of the Altar,
which, if there is any truth in my notions of Ordination,
is more sacred than the Holy of Holies was in the Jewish
Temple.</p>

<p>‘I have just heard that the postman is going, and so must
write for my life. The College is about fourteen miles from
Bridge Town, and about in the same latitude on the east side
of the island. It is a long handsome stone building, which
has been very ill-repaired since the hurricane. It consists of a
<!--178.png--><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pageno">150</span>
Hall and Chapel, each about fifty feet long, with a handsome
porch between them, and two wings in which the rooms are.
I will give you a sketch in my next. The Principal’s house,
which is a separate building at the west end, is a very good
specimen of a Queen Anne house, only without chimneys.
The carving of the staircase and doors is very costly, in cedar.
It is so well built that the hurricane hardly hurt it at all. I
generally drink tea there; but breakfast and dine in my rooms.
I get out of bed as soon as it is light, if they bring me my
coffee so soon; else I wait for it. You can’t think how odd
one feels at getting up without a cup of it. I did not feel
this at first, and perhaps it is only habit now. I breakfast at
half-past eight, dine at three: give Lectures from twelve to
two; and the rest of the day give my body as much exercise,
and my mind as little, as I can. There are about fourteen
students here: very little for so expensive an establishment.
If I was the Bishop, I should not make it a place for the
exclusive education of gentlemen, but should let the respectable
coloured people, who had time and inclination to study
divinity, come here and prepare for Orders, without insisting
on Latin and Greek. These colonies are not ripe for supporting
a learned clergy; the wealthy are too irreligious to
pay towards the maintenance of anything like a sufficient
number to look after the population. The Bishop should take
people of the caste in life that the Wesleyan ministers come
from, and taking care to keep a tight hand over them, should
ordain all who have sufficient zeal and knowledge to undertake
the burden. I will not even insist on their giving up their
trades; for if a parish priest can keep a school, I am sure he
may make shoes without giving up more of his time: and if
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul could maintain himself by tent-making while he
discharged the duties of an Apostle, I don’t see why other
people should not be able to maintain themselves as well, while
they do the duties of a parish priest. The notion that a priest
must be a gentleman is a stupid exclusive Protestant fancy,
and ought to be exploded. If they would educate a lower
caste here, they would fill the College directly.’</p>

<p class="p2">It was not long after the date of this letter that a restoration,
<!--179.png--><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pageno">151</span>
not ‘an addition,’ as Mr. Thomas Mozley says,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_187" id="fnanchor_187"></a><a href="#footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></span> was made,
from Hurrell’s designs and under his superintendence, of
Codrington College. The hurricane which had wrought the
original havoc spent itself in August, 1831. The great
porch between Chapel and Hall, an open passage locally
known as the Belfry, was rebuilt, retaining the triple arch
below, but not the cupola or small dome which formerly lifted
itself over the palm-trees and the bridged waters. The whole
remains as our amateur architect left it. Busy as he was, he
thirsted for fuller news from home.</p>

<p>‘… By the time you get this, it will be near a year since
I have heard a word about you…. Of N[ewman] I heard
as late as December 15, 1833: I have just referred to the
rascal’s letter. But as to K[eble] and C[hristie] and you and
the M[ozleys], I am in utter ignorance on which side the Styx
you are all residing…. I have entirely left off animal food,
which has cooled me without weakening me; and I have left
off writing radicalism, which did myself harm, and no one else
any good: for I see neither N[ewman] nor [Rose] will take any
of it. Also, above all, I have left off thinking, which, on
matured reflection, I am convinced is the great evil of human
life…. If the sun was not so intensely hot as to make sitting
in the open air intolerable (<em>N.B.</em>, there is no shade here), I
should take to drawing; but, somehow, there is not much to
tempt one in that department. The lights and shades are here
a third proportional to the lights and shades of an English
summer day, and those on a moonlight night. Everything is
one mass of brightness, except for the first and last half-hours
of the day. The skies, too, are entirely deficient in that glow
which one’s English imagination associates with heat; pale
transparency, which one can hardly look at for its brilliance,
stares at one on every side, and every part of the sky reflects
<!--180.png--><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pageno">152</span>
so much light on every part of the landscape, that you may
apply to day what Virgil says of night:</p>

<p>‘The two things which I should like to make drawings of
are the bread-fruit tree, and the particular kind of palm which,
in the poetical language of the country, they call the cabbage-tree;
both of which are certainly very beautiful, the former
most especially so; and both so unlike anything English, that
I don’t yet understand how to touch the foliage…. I have
two very pleasant rooms in the pleasantest spot in the whole
island, and battel just as at Oxford, which serves to keep up a
pleasant illusion. The College is about four hundred feet
above the sea, which is about two-thirds of a mile off, and the
aspect of my sitting-room is straight towards England; so that

<p>‘This windward coast is for ever exposed to the full roll of
the Atlantic, and its monotonous perturbation wearies one’s
imagination, as well as the mud and sand, neither of which
does it suffer to repose for a moment. I often wish for what
I used to think no very interesting object, the motionless calms
of Torbay or Dartmouth.’</p>

<p class="p2">‘Rogers heard from Froude yesterday,’ runs a postscript of
Newman to Keble on <abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 10. ‘He says nothing about his
health, but is evidently homesick and lonely.’ And two days
after, Newman tenderly explains to Hurrell himself: ‘I am
not surprised you should be so unjust to me, for I should
be so to you under the same circumstances. You see we
expected you here with the Bishop of Barbados till the
middle of May, and therefore did not send letters. When we
found him here without you, we instantly began to write; by
accidents which we could not help (<i>e.g.</i>, the box was a fortnight
on the road to Dartington), it was August before it was off.
However, you had news of Oxford up to the minute of its
<!--181.png--><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pageno">153</span>
going…. Keble’s father has taken to his bed, and is so ill
that Keble does not leave him.’</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hurrell had pursued his grievance, attacking Mr.
Keble with wistful humour, during October. ‘I wish I knew
Horace’s receipt for giving the sound of a swan to mute fishes,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_189" id="fnanchor_189"></a><a href="#footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></span>
and I most certainly should administer you a dose. I know
you must have a great deal on your hands, so I should be
contented with extracting only two pages in as big a hand as
an idle undergraduate’s theme: but I really do wish to hear
something of you…. Concerning your worship’s self, I have
been able to collect that you were in existence on or about the
12th of June last…. [Davison’s?] death was a great surprise
to me, and I may almost say a shock, as I had always looked
to him to do something great for us…. Do you know, I
partly fear that you … are going to back out of the conspiracy
and leave me and [Newman] to our fate? I mean
to ally myself to him in a close league, and put as much
mischief into his head as I can. He has sent me a great
many of his pamphlets, etc., which I admire greatly for their
<ins title="êthos">ἦθος</ins> and execution; and I have written back to him, pointing
out wherein I think him too conservative.’</p>

<p>The deceased colleague may well have been John Davison,
who had died on the sixth day of May, 1834; but Hurrell would
not have seen the announcement before July. Davison is
commonly reckoned as one of the old school, the Oriel Noetics,
or Liberals; but there is a contrary impression of him to be
drawn from some charming pages in Mozley’s <cite>Reminiscences</cite>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_190" id="fnanchor_190"></a><a href="#footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></span>
Newman twice names him with Rose as a steadfast encourager
of the earliest <cite>Tracts</cite>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_191" id="fnanchor_191"></a><a href="#footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></span> There is no doubt that he sympathised
with the Tractarians more than his indecisive habit would
suffer him to testify by deed, and he was much beloved by
them. Hurrell’s expectation of ‘something great’ from him
would almost inevitably centre about the Scripture Commentary
which he was known to be writing and rewriting, but his
fastidious self-criticism got the better of that and him, after a
most Oxonian fashion, as he directed his widow to burn all
<!--182.png--><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span class="pageno">154</span>
his manuscripts. Besides, he was fifty-seven, and naturally preferred
an evening siesta on Troy Wall to any chances of war.
Newman, looking back, wrote feelingly of him in April, 1842:
‘It is surely mysterious, considering what the world is, how it
needs improvement, and, moreover, that this life is the appropriate
time for action, or, what is emphatically called in Scripture,
work, that they who seem gifted for the definite purpose of influencing
and edifying their brethren, should be allowed to do
so much less than might be expected…. Left to ourselves,
we are apt to grudge that the powers of such a mind as [Mr.
Davison’s] have not had full range in his age and country, and that
a promise of such high benefits should, owing to circumstances
beyond man’s control, have been but partially accomplished.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_192" id="fnanchor_192"></a><a href="#footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">Hurrell’s playful use of the word ‘conspiracy’ to indicate
the Movement, will be noted. It was habitual with him from
the first. It irritated many excellent persons at the time; it
irritated Dean Burgon fifty years later. In the chapter
devoted to Mr. Rose, in <cite>Twelve Good Men</cite>, Dean Burgon
administers to Hurrell an oblique rebuke. ‘Froude, a man
of splendid abilities and real genius, but sadly wanting in
judgment and of fatal indiscretion, rendered the good cause
the greatest disservice in his power by speaking of the
Hadleigh Conference in a letter to a friend as “the conspiracy”:
which letter was soon afterward published.’ Yet the word was
really employed, and it may have been even invented, a fortnight
before the meeting at Hadleigh, by none other than Mr.
William Palmer! ‘Now I hope you will be able to join in
this little plan and conspiracy,’ he wrote to Mr. Perceval on
July 10, 1833. A more recent, and an equally historic use
of the word (not ironic in the least, this time), is Archbishop
Tait’s, in condemning the publications of the Society of the
Holy Cross:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_193" id="fnanchor_193"></a><a href="#footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></span> ‘to counteract what I feel obliged to call a
<span class="muchsmaller">CONSPIRACY</span> within our own body against the doctrine, the
discipline and the practice of our Reformed Church.’</p>

<p><!--183.png--><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><span class="pageno">155</span>
In this later Newman correspondence, as Miss Mozley the
Editor of it remarks, ‘R. H. Froude appears more as critic
than originator or author. His more intimate friends required
his criticism, and rested on his judgment. In his own person,
this faculty acted mainly as a check. He often speaks of trial
and failure in his own attempts to bring out what was working
in his mind; as, for instance: “I have tried to write a
criticism on the Apollo [Belvedere], but cannot bring out
my meaning, which is abstruse and metaphysico-poetical. I
always get bombastic, and am forced to scratch out.” His
critical faculty was too masterful to be practised upon himself,
but when exercised for the benefit of friends to whom he looked
up, he could give free license to a pungent pen, and yet leave
the modern reader to understand how anxious those friends
might well be to secure his comments, as long as they were
attainable. Keble, in his own simple way, sends his papers
to his old pupil to be overlooked by him; and Mr. Newman
was more at ease with Froude’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">imprimatur</i>. Thus, he sends
him draughts of papers; for example, “<abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 2, Keble’s, <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 1,
mine”; with the order: “criticise the whole very accurately in
matter and style, and send it back by return of post.” Of
course the state of Froude’s health made criticism more
possible than authorship, but, also, different intellectual powers
and functions are called into play.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_194" id="fnanchor_194"></a><a href="#footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>It is certainly noticeable enough, in all the intercourse of
these years, between Keble, Newman and Froude, how the
ordinary business of the University is completely ignored. It
is like necromancy to remember that men were really still
hastily reading the <cite>Ethics</cite> by the fire, and emptying bottles,
and, with their pipes, racing off to Shotover, through the white
salve-like mud, for a constitutional. ‘The <cite>Tracts</cite>,’ says Mr.
Mark Pattison sadly, ‘desolated Oxford life, and suspended,
for an indefinite period, all science and humane letters, and the
first strivings for intellectual freedom which had moved in the
bosom of Oriel.’ Such æsthetic havoc was never caused in a city,
unless under Savonarola, when all the wonted social graces went
to the dust-bin, and works of art made acceptable fagots, and
Christ was hailed, without legal precedent, King of Florence.</p>

<p><!--184.png--><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pageno">156</span>
On November 18, 1834, Newman resumes, in reference to
complaints from Hurrell, ‘suffering under intolerable delays
incident to distant correspondence in those days’:</p>

<p>‘I am so angry with you, I cannot say! Have we not
sent you a full box? That up to <abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 29 you had not
received it, is as hard for us to bear as for you. Why will
you not have a little faith?… I suppose all this is for your
good. You want a taming in various ways. It is to wean
you from your over-interest in politics … so you see you are
being taught to unlearn the world, the ecclesiastical as well as
the worldly world. A strange thought came across me about
you some six weeks ago, when I saw a letter from Tucker<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_195" id="fnanchor_195"></a><a href="#footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></span> of
C. C. C., giving an account of his prospects in India. He
is not at all an imaginative or enthusiastic man; but really,
a religious spirit has sprung up among military men at our
stations, and having no angel to direct them to Joppa, they
have turned Evangelicals. The various sects there have a
leaning towards the Church, and the men of colour are forming
centres of operation. My thought was, if your health would
not let you come home, you ought to be a Bishop in India….’</p>

<p>What Newman did not confess to his friend was that he had
dreamed of their fates as one: he, too, would be a Bishop in
India. To his sister Jemima he had written from Tunbridge
Wells on October 2: ‘I have been much struck with a most
sensible account of the state of India just received here
from Mr. Tucker, in almost every word of which (it is
full of practical and doctrinal matters), I agree. Though he is
a Calvinist, I do believe our differences would, in India,
almost be a matter of a few words. He gives a most exciting
account of his field of labour, without intending it. At this
moment, could I choose, and have all circumstances and
providences at my disposal, I would go as an independent
Bishop to his part of India, and found a Church there. This,
you will say, is an ambitious flight. I am sure some one
ought to be sent as Bishop; but the State, the State! we are
crippled. I can fancy the day coming when India might be
a refuge, if our game was up here.’ Froude agreed. He
<!--185.png--><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><span class="pageno">157</span>
says elsewhere: ‘The present Church system is an incubus
upon the country. It spreads its arms in all directions, claiming
the whole surface of the earth for its own, and refusing
a place to any subsidiary system to spring upon. Would that
the waters would throw up some Acheloides, where some new
Bishop might erect a See beyond the blighting influence of our
upas trees.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_196" id="fnanchor_196"></a><a href="#footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></span> Yet I suppose that before he could step in, an
Act of Parliament would put its paw upon the <ins title="krêsphygeton">κρησφύγετον</ins>,
and include it within the limits of some adjacent diocese.
I admire [Mozley’s?] hit about our being united to the State
as Israel was to Egypt.’</p>

<p>To return to the letter sent to Barbados on November 18.
Around this half-quaint suggestion of young mitred revolutionaries
in unhampered Sees, Newman’s love and genius break
forth together.</p>

<p>‘It quite amused<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_197" id="fnanchor_197"></a><a href="#footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></span> me for awhile, and made me think how
many posts there are in His Kingdom, how many offices,
who says to one “Do this, and he doeth it,” etc. It is quite
impossible that some way or other you are not destined to be
the instrument of God’s purposes. Though I saw the earth
cleave and you fall in, or Heaven open, and a chariot appear,
I should say just the same. God has ten thousand posts of
service. You might be of use in the central elemental fire;
you might be of use in the depths of the sea.’</p>

<p>To the editor of the <cite>Letters and Correspondence to 1845</cite>
we owe, again, this enriching footnote:</p>

<p>‘In <abbr title="Volume two">Vol. ii.</abbr> of the <cite>Parochial Sermons</cite> (Ascension Day, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 214)
there is a passage which throws light on this ardent confident
strain, prompted as it is evidently by the failure of hope in
his friend’s recovery for service in this present scene. “Moreover,
<!--186.png--><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="pageno">158</span>
this departure of Christ and coming of the Holy Ghost
leads our minds with great comfort to the thought of many lower
dispensations of Providence towards us…. This is a thought
which is particularly soothing as regards the loss of friends, or
of especially gifted men who seem, in their day, the earthly
support of the Church…. Doubtless, ‘it is expedient’ they
should be taken away; otherwise some great mercy will not
come to us. They are taken away, perchance, to other
duties in God’s service equally ministrative to the salvation
of the elect as earthly service. Christ went to intercede with
the Father: we do not know, we may not boldly speculate, yet
it may be that Saints departed intercede, unknown to us, for
the victory of the Truth upon earth … they are taken away
for some purpose surely; their gifts are not lost to us; their
soaring minds, the fire of their contemplations, the sanctity of
their desires, the vigour of their faith, the sweetness and
gentleness of their affections, were not given without an
object.”’</p>

<p>Lastly, the long letter closes with a little budget of news
welcome to the exile, and with its crowded mention of names
unforgotten, familiar fifty years after as they were then.</p>

<p>‘The Tracts now form a thick volume. We have put
a title-page and preface to them, and called them <cite>Tracts
for 1833-4</cite>. I think you will like them, as a whole. You
go too fast yourself. Williams has been so unwell, we were
going to send him out to you; but he has lately mended.
I have just engaged with Rivington to publish another volume
of <cite>Sermons</cite>. The first volume was nearly sold off in the
course of nine months: one thousand copies. I have not
dared all along to indulge the hope that I should be
favoured with having you here again; but now really the
prospect seems clearing. I do not like to say so, lest I
break a spell! Rogers’ eyes are little or not at all better.
Gladstone is turning out a fine fellow. Harrison has made
him confess that the doctrine of the Apostolical Succession
is irresistible.’</p>

<p>A long letter to Newman, on <abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 23, opens: ‘Do you
know, I am hungry and thirsty to hear about you, and
whether your health stands, in the midst of your occupations?
<!--187.png--><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span class="pageno">159</span>
My father tells me your <cite>Sermons</cite> are talked of in
all directions…. I have entirely left off meat; my dinner
is toast, and a basin of very weak chicken broth. Breakfast
is my chief meal, and consists of a vast joram<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_198" id="fnanchor_198"></a><a href="#footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></span> of milk
and arrow-root. It is an odd thing, [as] milk never used
to agree with me, but I find that by putting a good lot
of cinnamon into it, I can digest any quantity. I find I
must not take exercise so as to put me out of breath, as
that increases my cough, yet the more I take the stronger
I get; so that I am in a dilemma, which I shall cut by
borrowing one of the Bishop’s horses instead of walking. I
am perforce as idle as possible, my chief occupation being
to keep thoughts out of my head. In this respect I find
my friend Sanctus Thomas<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_199" id="fnanchor_199"></a><a href="#footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></span> of infinite use. Dawdling over
translations, and picking facts out of allusions just keep one
going for the time, without supplying any materials to brood
over. If you see Keble, congratulate him on the Yank
edition of <cite>The Christian Year</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_200" id="fnanchor_200"></a><a href="#footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></span> which has gone on Oakeley’s<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_201" id="fnanchor_201"></a><a href="#footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></span>
plan of putting the fine passages in italics. It is amusing
to see the selection which he<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_202" id="fnanchor_202"></a><a href="#footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></span> has made…. As to sentiment,
I am heartily tired of this place and climate. I am sure
it has been too hot for me, particularly during August,
September, and October, the hurricane months. I fancy,
too, if there was something more to interest one, I should
have been benefited by it. Niggerland is a poor substitute
for the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">limen Apostolorum</i>! However, I do verily believe
that if I had stayed in England I should have had a
<!--188.png--><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><span class="pageno">160</span>
confirmed disease on my lungs by this time…. I have
not written a verse since I have been out here, and could
not, for the life of me…. If I had the necessary books
here, I should like much to get together materials for the
Lives of Bishops Andrewes, Cosin, and Overall. They
might be made into a nice first volume for a series of Lives
of Apostolical Divines of the Church of England: a genus
which seems to me to have come into existence about the
beginning of James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, and to have become extinct with the
Nonjurors…. I wish I could say, as John of Salisbury of
Saint Thomas: “<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Domino Cantuarensi, quoad literaturam et
mores, plurimum profuit exilium illud.</cite>” But somehow I think
I have become even more uncharitable and churlish than I
was!’</p>

<p>Hurrell addressed both Christie and Newman on Saint
Stephen’s Day. The letter to the former caused immense
laughter at Oriel. ‘Even Froude is beginning to joke about
matrimony!’ writes James Mozley to his sister. Never was
a joke in less danger of becoming practical.</p>

<p class="p2">The letter to Newman, as usual, goes deeper, and touches

<p>‘… There was a passage in a letter I have just received
from my father that made me feel so infinitely dismal, that I
must write to you about it. He says you have written to him
to learn something about me, and to ask what to do with my
money. It really made me feel as if I was dead, and you
were sweeping up my remains; and, by the by, if I was dead,
why should I be cut off from the privilege of helping on the
Good Cause? I don’t know what money I left: little enough

<p>‘… My father’s letter was a dismal one altogether. He
tells me Isaac<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_210" id="fnanchor_210"></a><a href="#footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></span> is far from well, and Sir George and Lady
Prevost obliged to leave England. Also that my poor sister
[Phillis] has just sailed for Madeira to escape the winter, for
fear of an affection just like mine…. Also that Mr. Keble<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_211" id="fnanchor_211"></a><a href="#footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></span>
is supposed to be on his death-bed. About you personally
I hear nothing. As for myself, it really seems as if I was
going to have a respite. I have still some symptoms which
make me fear it may turn out moonshine, <i>e.g.</i>, great irritability
of pulse, and shortness of wind in walking up hill. But everyone
says, and I cannot help observing, that my looks are
greatly altered for the better…. Sometimes I seem to
myself very ridiculous to give way to such doleful thoughts,
considering how very little there is apparently the matter with
me; and if it was not for the effect consumption had taken
on my … family, I should be ashamed of myself. But the pertinacity
of my trifling ailment has sometimes seemed to me like a
warning that fate had put its hand on me for the next [world].</p>

<p>‘When I get your letter, I expect a rowing for my Roman
Catholic sentiments. Really, I hate the Reformation and the
Reformers more and more,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_212" id="fnanchor_212"></a><a href="#footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></span> and have almost made up my
mind that the Rationalist spirit they set afloat is the
<ins title="pseudoprophêtês]">ψευδοπροφήτης</ins> of the Revelations. I have a theory about the
Beast and Woman too, which conflicts with yours; but which
I will not inflict on you now. I have written nothing for a
long time, and only read in a desultory, lounging way; but
really, it is not out of idleness, for I find that the less I do the

heresy, even Socinianism. I must write you out a sentence
<!--196.png--><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pageno">164</span>

he says: “<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il a demeuré caché sous la voile de la nature qui
nous le couvre, jusqu’à l’Incarnation; et quand il a fallu qu’il
ait paru, il s’est encore plus caché, en se couvrant de l’humanité….
Enfin, quand il a voulu accomplir la promesse qu’il fit à
ses apôtres de demeurer avec les hommes jusqu’à son dernier
avènement, il a choisi demeurer dans le plus étrange et le plus
obscur secret de tous: savoir, sous les espèces de l’Eucharistie.</cite>”
And then he goes on to say that deists penetrate the veil of
Nature, heretics that of the Incarnation; “<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mais pour nous, nous
devons nous estimer heureux de ce que Dieu nous éclaire jusqu’à
le reconnaître sous les espèces du pain et du vin</cite>.” I believe

Church</em> for anything except excommunicating us. So much
for fault-finding…. I am amused to see among your

who, by the bye, is now at Madeira…. I have two
schemes about the <cite>Tracts</cite>…. 1st, I should like a series

2nd, I think one might take the Jansenist saints, Francis de
Sales,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_220" id="fnanchor_220"></a><a href="#footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></span> the nuns of Port Royal, Pascal, etc., who seem to me

own, and to give more room for writing <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad captandum</i>….
Must it not be owned that the Church of England Saints,
however good in essentials, are, with a few rare exceptions,
deficient in the austere beauty of the Catholic <ins title="êthos">ἦθος</ins>? K[eble]
will be severe on me for this, but I cannot deny that Laud’s
architecture seems to me typical.’</p>

<p class="p2">This is the letter so charmingly annotated for us by Lord
Blachford’s anecdote. ‘There’s a Basil for you!’ said Newman,
with humorous deprecation, when he read the grudging advice
to lay by, in his great weariness, ever so little of his accustomed
work. The comparison rose readily to his lips, for he
had been busy writing the chapters of his <cite>Church of the
Fathers</cite>, month by month, and he was fresh from the beautiful
portraiture of SS. Basil and Gregory Nazianzum.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_221" id="fnanchor_221"></a><a href="#footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></span> He had
called Hurrell his Basil under no mere momentary sense of
a certain ineradicable blithe hardness in his friend. Newman,
as sensitive and seeing as <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Gregory himself, must have been
conscious at the time how mysteriously fragments of modern
<!--198.png--><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pageno">166</span>
biography were getting lodged into his Early Christian
exegetics: for in truth he and Hurrell were as like Gregory
and Basil as their impersonators in a miracle play. The
analogy is not irrelevant, and it is the more attractive the
more it is followed out, especially as there is in it nothing
akin to the painful difference which long severed the loving-hearted
great Saints from each other. ‘Basil’ at Dartington
pitied no one much, himself least of all; the personal consideration
affected him at all times as little as it had affected
his mighty archetype, a man of yea and nay, of cloudless
vision and unstinted enterprise.</p>

<p>Newman had written: ‘One of the more striking points
of Basil’s character was his utter disregard of mere human
feeling where the interests of religion were concerned….
This self-sacrifice, which he observed in his own case for the
good of the Church, he scrupled not to extend to the instance
of those to whom he was related, and for whom he had to act.
His brother and his intimate friend, the two Gregories of
Nyssa and Nazianzum, felt the keenness and severity of his
zeal as well as the comfort of his affection.’ And again:
‘Gregory disliked the routine intercourse of society, he disliked
ecclesiastical business, he disliked publicity, he disliked
strife …; he loved the independence of solitude, the tranquillity
of private life, leisure for meditation, reflection, self-government;
study and literature. He admired, yet he
playfully satirised Basil’s lofty thoughts and heroic efforts.
Yet upon Basil’s death, Basil’s spirit, as it were, came into
him…. Was it Gregory or was it Basil that blew the trumpet
in Constantinople, and waged a successful war in the very
seat of the enemy, in despite of all his fluctuations of mind,
misgivings, fastidiousness, disgust with self, and love of quiet?
Such was the power of the great Basil, triumphing in his
death, though failing throughout his life. Within four or five
years of his departure to his reward, all the objects were either
realised, or in the way to be realised, which he had vainly
attempted and sadly waited for. His eyes had failed in
longing: they waited for the Morning, and death closed them
ere it came.’ All this amounts to a strange and touching
forecast.</p>

<p><!--199.png--><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pageno">167</span>
Newman writes again most tenderly on <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 18, from
London.</p>

<p>‘… I could say much, were it of use, of my own solitariness,
now you are away. Not that I would undervalue that
great blessing, which is what I do not deserve, of so many
friends about me: dear Rogers, Williams, <ins title="ho pany">ὁ πάνυ</ins> Keble, and
the friend in whose house I am staying (whom I wish with
all my heart you knew as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Apostolicorum princeps</i>, Bowden);
yet, after all, as is obvious, no one can enter into one’s mind
except a person who has lived with one. I seem to write
things to no purpose, as wanting your imprimatur. Perhaps
it is well to cultivate the habit of writing as if for unseen
companions; but I have felt it much, so that I am getting
quite dry and hard. My dear Froude, come back to us as
soon as you safely can; and then next winter, please God, you
shall go to Rome, and tempt Isaac, who is very willing, to go
with you. But wherever you are (so be it!) you cannot be
divided from us.’</p>

<p class="p2">Hurrell held an irregular correspondence with some old
friends to whom he was warmly attached, and remembered
them in his winter leisure.</p>

<p>‘I would give twopence if circumstances should ever so
turn up that you could make an occasional residence in
Oxford compatible with your clerical duties,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_222" id="fnanchor_222"></a><a href="#footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></span> and that we
could concoct a second edition of old times again. It makes
me laugh when I think of your old clipped horse, and how I
was choused<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_223" id="fnanchor_223"></a><a href="#footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></span> by John G.; and sundry other matters which
come into one’s head when more serious matters ought to
be there. I wonder if you are the same fellow now that
you used to be? I am afraid my old self is determined to
stick by me till the last. But to talk sense: I really do
indulge the hope that sometime we may be thrown together
<!--200.png--><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pageno">168</span>
again. Undoubtedly you owe a debt to your destinies, which
as a mere parish priest you can never repay. Your old project
about the Mendicant Orders was the sort of thing: though
perhaps something connected with later times would tell more
just at present. As to myself, <ins title="theôn en gounasi keitai">θεῶν ἐν γούνασι κεῖται</ins> whether
I am ever to be of any use, though I now begin to entertain
serious hopes that I shall recover. Perhaps you know that I
have been out here, in exile <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter nigridas</i>, for this year and a
quarter. The first winter I got very little good; and in the
summer the heat kept me in a feverish state, which low diet
could not counteract; so I began to think it was up with me;
<ins title="hotan hydôr pnigê">ὅταιν ὕδωρ πνίγῃ</ins>, etc., and I own I felt very doleful: but since
the cool weather set in I have made a decided start, which has
put me in a better humour; and the cooler it is the better I
am; so that I dare say if I had gone to Madeira, or to Rome
a second time, I might have been well. I shall not be sorry
for an excuse for spending another winter in the south of
Europe.</p>

<p>‘While out here I have stuck to my old prejudices as tight
as I could; yet I fairly own that I think the niggers less
incapable of being raised in the scale of being than I used. I
don’t mean that, generally speaking, they are at all fit for the
situation in which the law has placed them; but that here and
there you see specimens which prove them, unequivocally
enough, to be of the race of Adam, is not to be denied. Many
of them are clever, and some affectionate and even honest, and
if a more judicious system had been pursued, I should not
have despaired of seeing them become generally so. As it is,
the prospect is even in this island a very gloomy one, and
in the others, the state of things seems next to hopeless. In
Antigua, where they are quite let loose, they have been playing
a very clever trick in many places: which is very characteristic
of the negro intellect, sharp enough as to the moment, and
absolutely without thought as to the next. In making sugar
it is very important that the canes should be squeezed as soon
as possible after they are cut: a few hours hurts them, and
twenty-four spoils them; so our friends Quakoo and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr> cut
away very diligently, and then strike for wages. Here in
Barbados they cannot play the same trick, as the magistrates
<!--201.png--><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pageno">169</span>
would flog them; and indeed flogging is scarcely less common,
and more severe now, than under the old system. In this
island, the most melancholy result of the change yet discernible
is the condition of the emancipated children under
six. The mothers, who have gone on hitherto in their lax
amours with a certainty that any consequences that might
result would be rather in their favour than otherwise, have
been bringing a host of wretched urchins into the world and
consigning them over to the estate nurses, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans soin</i>; and now
the produce of the last six years is returned upon their hands,
unless they will consent to apprentice them; this they will not
do, out of spite to their masters, but take the trouble on
themselves they will not: so the squalid little wretches starve
and die off shockingly; and those that live are locked up in
their mother’s house while she is at work, doing nothing but
quarrel, growing up in absolute uselessness, and with no chance
of improving…. As to the religious prospects of these
colonies, I think them very bad indeed. If the Church was
thrown on the voluntary system, and left to make its way as
the Wesleyans do among the poorer classes, it would make
sure as it went, though perhaps the progress might at first seem
slow; but now all is mere show and rottenness…. Another
difficulty arises from the views of the Clergy: those who have
any deference for Church authority are too generally mere Z’s….
Religious instruction out here means marrying the niggers,
baptizing them, and teaching them to read.</p>

<p class="p2">Sir James Stephen was very wroth with Froude for his
attitude towards the slaves of the West Indian Colonies,
deducing that attitude from some allusions of Froude’s own
to ‘anti-slavery cant.’ The Editors of the <cite>Remains</cite> attest that
Hurrell did not suffer (as later Mr. J. A. Froude was said to
do, from other alleged causes) from negrophobia. But certainly
his speech about ‘the niggers’ does not always sound

reassuring. Perhaps in this, as in other matters, he leans upon
the reader’s general knowledge of him, and requires that to
supply the marginal comment.</p>

<p>It is a common jibe against reformers, though not always
a true one, that their range of ideas is disproportioned or
partial. Members of the Anti-Vivisection Society are supposed
to be indifferent to wife-beating. Perhaps, if known,
Hurrell’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tendre</i> for his only Roman Catholic, Monsignor Wiseman,
and for ‘Roman Catholic sentiments,’ as he calls them,
would seem enough to account for his limitations of sympathy
on an island where he spent an unwilling year-and-a-half. It
is interesting that to a Wilberforce, of all persons, he confides
his final impressions, still pessimistic enough, of ‘our brothers
carved in ebony.’ The Bill for the total abolition of slavery in
the British dominions had received the Royal assent on August
28, 1833, and had come at last into full operation as Froude
wrote. He was not wont, in other matters, to judge of the
justice of a measure by its practical workings, or by the local
material it had to work upon.</p>

<p>Hurrell approaches Keble in his most lucid and mischievous
argumentative mood on the same day.</p>

<p>‘I have a miscellaneous jumble of things that I want to
talk to you about, if I can but arrange them in any sort of
order…. And first, I shall attack you for the expression
“The Church teaches” so-and-so, which I observe is in the
Tract<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_225" id="fnanchor_225"></a><a href="#footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></span> equivalent to “The Prayer-Book etc. teach[es] us”
so-and-so. Now suppose a conscientious layman to inquire on
what grounds the Prayer-Book etc., are called the teaching of
the Church: how shall we answer him? Shall we tell him
that they are embodied in an Act of Parliament? So is the
Spoliation Bill. Shall we tell him that they were formerly
enacted by Convocation in the reign of Charles <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></span>? But what
especial claim had this Convocation to monopolise the name
and authority of the Church? Shall we tell him that all the
clergy assented to them ever since their enactment? But to
what interpretation of them have all, or even the major part of
the clergy assented? For if it is the assent of the clergy that
makes the Prayer-Book etc. the teaching of the Church, the
<!--203.png--><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pageno">171</span>
Church teaches only that interpretation of them to which all,
or at least the majority of the clergy have assented; and in
order to ascertain this, it will be necessary to inquire, not for
what may seem to the inquirer to be their real meaning, but
for the meaning which the majority of the clergy have, in
fact, attached to them! It will be necessary to poll the
Hoadleians, Puritans, and Laudians, and to be determined by
[the] most votes. Again, supposing him to have ascertained
these, another question occurs. Why is the opinion of the
English clergy, since the enactment of the Prayer-Book,
entitled to be called the teaching of the Church, more than
that of the clergy of the sixteen previous centuries; or, again,
than the clergy of France, Italy, Spain, Russia, etc., etc.? I
can see no other claim which the Prayer-Book has on a
layman’s deference, as the teaching of the Church, which the
Breviary and Missal have not in a far greater degree….
I know you will snub me for this…. Surely no teaching
nowadays is authoritative in the sense in which the Apostles’
was, except the Bible? nor any in the sense in which
Timothy’s was, except that of Primitive Tradition? To find
a sense in which the teaching of the modern clergy is authoritative,
I confess baffles me.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_226" id="fnanchor_226"></a><a href="#footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></span> …</p>

as I do when making them! I see [that] on one and the
same day I must have sent my father a cheerful account,
and you a dismal one. I am forced to say something, but
have no data to judge by, and so talk at random. Certain
indeed I am that my pulse is still progressively calming,
<!--205.png--><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="pageno">173</span>
and that now it is scarcely more irritable than it ought to
be; but in nothing else can I be sure that I change at
all…. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Favus distillans labia tua</i>, as someone said to John
of Salisbury.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_229" id="fnanchor_229"></a><a href="#footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></span> What can have put it into your head that your
style is dull? The letter you sent me in the box was among
the most amusing I ever received. I have now made up my
mind to come back [in] the packet after the next, so as to be
in England the middle of May, and am not wholly without
hope that the voyage may do something for me. The
notion of going to Rome with Isaac is very gratifying. I
must learn French for it, though; for I have no notion of
trusting “Providence,” as I did last time. The sun has
already got almost to his full strength, though the earth is of
course [only] beginning to collect its stock of caloric, and the
experience of last year assures me that the less I have of it
the better…. I am most sincerely sorry to hear of Mr.
K[eble’s] death.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_230" id="fnanchor_230"></a><a href="#footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></span> I suppose if there ever was anyone to whom
death was like going to bed, it would be Mr. K[eble]. I have
written lots of stuff since I have been out here, some of which
I must inflict on you on my return; but none of it will do
to publish. When I look over anything long after I write
it, I see such jumps and discontinuities as make me despair
of ever being intelligible. How I wish to see you all again!’</p>

<p class="p2">Shortly after this letter was sent to post, Hurrell left
Barbados for good. No personal records of him exist there,
and all memories of him have faded away. His face was set
at last towards another island where his few remaining days
could be crammed full of intelligent toil, and played at
their full value. From Bristol, on May 17, he was able to
announce: ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fratres desideratissimi</i>! here I am, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">benedictum sit
nomen Dei</i>, and as well as could be expected. I will not
boast, and indeed, have nothing<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_231" id="fnanchor_231"></a><a href="#footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></span> to boast of, as my pulse is
still far from satisfactory….</p>

<p><!--206.png--><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pageno">174</span>
‘When we asked our pilot “Who was Speaker?” he did
not know; but after much cross-examining he recollected that
he had heard it cried about the street that the old one was
turned out; who “the other gentleman” was, he could not tell.
Our next informant was the Custom House officer, who
boarded over night, when we anchored, to see that nothing
was taken out of the ship. All he knew was that “there had
been a jabbering” about a change of Ministers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_232" id="fnanchor_232"></a><a href="#footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></span> The day is
as dull and gloomy as possible; but after the torrid zone, any
English May day is “a sight for sair e’en.” … I hope to get
a sight of you soon. And now goodbye both! also I[saac]
and R[ogers], and all that are within reach.’</p>

<p>This is Newman’s narrative note, drawn, thirty years after,
from his own retentive memory:</p>

<p>‘R. H. F. made his appearance in Oxford on Tuesday,
May 18. On the morrow occurred the Convocation in the
Theatre, when the proposed innovation of a Declaration of
Conformity to the Church of England, instead of Subscription
to the Articles, was rejected by 459 to 57. It was the last
vote he gave…. He left Oxford, never to return, on June 4.
During this time Bowden was in Oxford; and for the first and
last time saw R. H. F.’</p>

<p>Miss Anne Mozley, too, remembered in old age her only
sight of Hurrell Froude.</p>

<p>‘It happened to [me], passing the coach office, in company
with Mrs. Newman, to see Froude as he alighted from the
coach which brought him to Oxford, and was being greeted by
his friends. He was terribly thin, his countenance dark and
wasted, but with a brilliancy of expression and grace of outline
which justified all that his friends had said of him. He was
in the Theatre next day, entering into all the enthusiasm of
the scene, and shouting <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non placet</i> with all his friends about
him. While he lived at all, he must live his life.’</p>

<p>Frederic Rogers was of the company at Convocation who

<!--209.png--><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pageno">175</span>
protested against a local Repeal of the Test and Corporation
Act. He had no very hopeful feelings about the much-welcomed
immigrant, and wrote to his sister from Oriel on May 2:</p>

<p>‘Wilson, Ryder, Wilberforce, Harding, spent several days
here, with a quantity of other contemporaries, and Hurrell
Froude arrived just in time from Barbados to cut into the
middle of it. It quite surprises me how little people change!
All these gentry, married and single, were so exactly what
they always had been, that I could hardly believe I was not
a freshman again. The only painful thing was that I fear
Barbados has not done much for Froude. I was quite shocked
to see him, but I suppose I had been too sanguine; his
wretched thinness struck me more than it had ever done.
They say, however, that no one ever gains flesh in the West
Indies, but that it tells when they come back: I most earnestly
trust it may be so. He talks of spending the winter at Rome
again, going straight there, and coming straight back. He
certainly cannot spend it in England. I cannot describe the
kind of sickness I felt in looking at him when just the first
meeting was over. I suppose it is a hopeful sign that his
spirits are just as high as they always were; at least, were so
when he first came here: for I am afraid we must look for a
change in that, as Newman tells me he has heard to-day that
his sister who was so ill is given over. I have not seen him
since his hearing the news. However, I am getting mopish.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_233" id="fnanchor_233"></a><a href="#footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>William Froude was still in Oxford also, having moved
into Hurrell’s vacant rooms. Says the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Thomas Mozley,
in his most entertaining book:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_234" id="fnanchor_234"></a><a href="#footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>‘William Froude gave his heart in with his brother’s work
at Oriel, though his turn even then was for science…. He
was the chemist, as well as the mechanist of the College. His
rooms on the floor over Newman’s were easily distinguishable
… by the stains of sulphuric acid (I think) extending from
the window-sills to the ground. The Provost must sometimes
have had to explain this appearance to his inquiring guests, as
they could not but observe it from his drawing-room window.’</p>

<p><!--210.png--><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pageno">176</span>
With Hurrell and William, during these May days, was
Anthony Froude, a boy of seventeen, coming up to Oriel with
his private Tutor (with whom he was reading in the neighbourhood)
in order to see his eldest brother.</p>

<p>‘When I went into residence at Oxford my brother was no
longer alive. He had been abroad almost entirely for three or
four years before his death; and although the atmosphere at
home was full of the new opinions, and I heard startling things
from time to time on Transubstantiation and suchlike, he had
little to do with my direct education. I had read at my own
discretion in my father’s library.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_235" id="fnanchor_235"></a><a href="#footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Anthony matriculated during the early December of this
very year, two months before Hurrell died. Perhaps not many
College rooms have known three such notable successive
occupiers of one family, each of strong idiosyncrasy, and alike
in nothing whatever but in personal charm.</p>

<p>The happy three weeks ended, Hurrell set out for Devon,
with Mr. Keble for companion part of the way. People who
had known him ‘looked horribly black at me, at first,’ until
they became ‘accustomed to my grim visage,’ he tells
Newman, five days later. Doubtless it was a harrowing thing
in the pastoral neighbourhood, this continual spectacle of
young faces at the Parsonage visibly withdrawing from the
summer air. And another indomitable dying Froude was
there, poor Phillis Spedding, the tradition of whose pathetic
beauty yet lingers about the Cumberland hillsides whither
she came as a bride.</p>

<p class="p2 center">To the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <span class="smcap">J. H. Newman</span>, Dartington, June 11, 1835.</p>

<p>‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dulcissime</i>, I got home Friday evening before dark very
comfortably. My poor sister is perfectly cheerful, and free
from pain, but daily declines in strength. Indeed, she is now
very visibly weakened since I first saw her. It is impossible
she should live many days. She is quite aware of her state,
and seems to be as composed, and almost [as] happy, as if she
was going to sleep…. There is something very indescribable
in the effect which old sights and smells produce in me here
<!--211.png--><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pageno">177</span>
just now, after having missed them so long. Also, old
Dartington House, with its feudal appendages, calls up so
many Tory associations as almost to soften one’s heart with
lamenting the course of events which is to re-erect the Church
by demolishing so much that is beautiful! “rich men living
peaceably in their habitations.” On my way from Oxford,
Keble talked a good deal about Church matters, and particularly
about the ancient Liturgies, and my analysis of Palmer,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_236" id="fnanchor_236"></a><a href="#footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></span>
which had put the facts to him in rather a new point of
view.’</p>

<p>And he reverts, in his animated vein, to the propaganda
never out of his thoughts, saying encouragingly to Newman:</p>

<p>‘I have heard from my sisters and the Champernownes of
the efficacy of your opuscula in leading captive silly women.
One very curious instance I heard the other day of an
exceedingly clever girl who for the last two or three years has
been occasionally laid up with a very painful illness, and
suffered severely. Nobody that she lives with can have acted
as channels for infecting her,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_237" id="fnanchor_237"></a><a href="#footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></span> as they are all either commonplace
sensible people, or Evangelical, or lax. But she has got
it into her head that there is a new party springing up in the
Church, which she calls “the new men,” and has been pumping
my sisters about you, and whether your notions are spreading,
etc…. They say she has been working the Dartmouth
Evangelicals with your <cite>Sermons</cite>, and made one of the parsons
knock under! I have also heard of a learned lady (a very good
and sensible person, by-the-bye), poking away most industriously
at your <cite>Arians</cite>, and saying that her views had been much
cleared by it.’</p>

<p class="p2">Phillis Spedding did not long survive her return to
England. She died at Dartington three days after the date of
Hurrell’s letter, on June 14, 1835, in her twenty-sixth year.
Her one little child, Edward Spedding, then aged eighteen
months, grew up only to attain his majority, and to be buried
in January, 1855, at Bassenthwaite, not with his mother.
<!--212.png--><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="pageno">178</span>
Thomas Story Spedding, living on at the manor which he had
so romantically inherited, married again.</p>

<p class="p2">Meanwhile, in Littlemore, Mrs. Newman was about to lay
the corner-stone of her son’s Early English chapel, with the
plans of which the architectural zeal of Mr. Thomas Mozley, the
Vicar’s future brother-in-law, had much to do. The rumour
that Hurrell Froude had designed it got some currency; and
there is a mirth-provoking growl on the subject in the pages
of that watchful worthy, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Peter Maurice of Yarnton,
Chaplain of New College.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_238" id="fnanchor_238"></a><a href="#footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></span> Upon the return of Newman and
Froude from Rome in 1833, he says, ‘we soon found that the
malaria of the Pontine marshes, the nondescript fogs of the
fatherland of all heresy, began to develop their miasmata in a
new diagnosis…. That edifice [Littlemore Church] was constructed
from outlines and plans sketched out for the architect
by an amateur friend of [Newman’s] own: the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> R. H.
Froude. It was in a particular style of Church architecture
which they were plotting to introduce. It was, in fact, the
very first Church in modern times<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_239" id="fnanchor_239"></a><a href="#footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></span> that was ever consecrated
with a stone altar, a stone cross, and credentia.’</p>

<p>Hurrell, however, at this very time, 1835, was busying
himself with artistic needs nearer home. After his death,
Archdeacon Froude wrote to Newman in one of his letters, which
affectionately begged for a visit: ‘I hear you have a splendid
Altar-table at Littlemore. That which dear Hurrell designed,
and had executed for my chancel, is now in its proper place.’
This was in December, 1836. Hurrell’s Altar, practically
modelled on the High Altar of Cologne Cathedral, has always
been preserved as his gift at Dartington, and constantly used;
it has undergone no alteration except that it had to be raised
for convenience, after Archdeacon Froude’s death, as he was
short, and both his successors have been very tall men. It was
<!--213.png--><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="pageno">179</span>
brought from the old Church to the new. Hurrell also changed
the place of the chancel-screen in the Church now destroyed,
moving it eastward, from the entrance to the choir, to enclose
the rail at the Altar-foot, so that none but communicants
passed beyond it: an irregular proceeding for an ecclesiologist.
But it seems clear that he meant by the action to emphasise
the sacredness of the Altar itself.</p>

<p>He was ever on the move, physically and mentally, in
and about his father’s parish. Neighbours and social equals
found it a bracing pleasure to see and hear him again, after
absence; he had the greatest possible influence with them;
those of his own age, fifty years later, and scattered all over
England, were still quoting him. He dearly loved children,
whom he met upon equal terms. Wherever there were
children, Hurrell was always testing their metal, while romping
with them. Would they run away from a comrade in danger?
Would they throw blame on others? Would they break promises?
He knew of what stuff every lamb of them was made,
and it has been quite impossible for any of these, either, to forget
him. This sweet solicitude, comeliest in one <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">auquel une grâce
particulière a révélé le prix et la beauté de la virginité sacerdotale</i>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_240" id="fnanchor_240"></a><a href="#footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></span>
played in and out among his graver cares. That, and the old
preoccupation with architecture, stood for his best diversions,
during his final year. It would appear that he also visited
London. The admirable critic of the Movement just quoted
lays some stress, in passing, on Hurrell’s interview with Dr.
Wiseman; he even surmises that it was caused by spiritual
anxieties of one sort or another.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_241" id="fnanchor_241"></a><a href="#footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></span> But he forgets that
Hurrell’s intention then was to return to Rome, and to historical
work in the Vatican Library, and that, long before, Dr.
Wiseman had promised his aid and interest in obtaining for
him facilities for research.</p>

<p class="p2">The Gothic plotter (no more Gothic, Mr. T. Mozley thinks,
<!--214.png--><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pageno">180</span>
than he should be), was employing his July of 1835 in outdoor
devices. He tried to allure Newman as far as Torbay. ‘I am
sure the lark will do you good, and the money (£2, 15s.) will
not be grossly misspent.’ To which his friend replies on
July 20: ‘… I should like of all things to come and see you,
but can say nothing to the proposal at present, being very busy
here, and being, in point of finances, in a very unsatisfactory
state. I am at present at Dionysius and the Abbé, whom Oh!
that I could despatch this vacation!’</p>

<p>This is the Abbé Jager, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Benjamin Harrison’s
Parisian friend, a lively, learned, and apparently provoking
controversialist, author of <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Protestantisme aux Prises avec la
Doctrine Catholique</cite>. Newman received his reply promptly from
Paignton, though he put off the visit. ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Frater desiderate</cite>,’
says Hurrell, ‘speak not of finances, since all the people here
are ready to subscribe for you; as for the Abbé, you can
work him here as well as anywhere. It is exquisitely pleasant
here: a hot sun with a fresh air is a luxury to which I have
long been a stranger. If you were to stay here a fortnight,
you might get on with your controversy, and be inspired for
the novel! I give out in all directions that you mean to write
it, and divulge the plot.’</p>

<p>Miss Mozley thus comments on this inciting of a new
literary activity in Newman. ‘There is nothing in the papers
before [me] to show that any ground whatever, in fact,
existed for the novel Froude here talks of. In the Postscript to
<cite>Callista</cite>, the author speaks of being stopped at the fifth chapter
“from sheer inability to devise personages or incidents.” Was
the attempt to express the feelings and mutual relations
of Christians and heathens in early Christian times already an
idea in the author’s mind?’ The intrinsic evidence is certainly
strong against the likelihood of Newman’s earlier story,
<cite>Loss and Gain</cite>, or anything remotely resembling it in subject
or framework, being contemplated in 1835. Attentive readers
of that very Oxonian book will recall, incidentally, that
Devonshire becomes the home of the Redings, and may even,
without being too fantastic, detect some faint irregular
adumbration of Hurrell Froude, Froude deduced as Newman
would fain have him, in the phantom figure, so illusive and
<!--215.png--><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pageno">181</span>
attractive, of Willis.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_242" id="fnanchor_242"></a><a href="#footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></span> Perhaps ‘the novel,’ the plot of which
Froude was so pleased to divulge, was but an original inspiration
of his own. He had long before formed a critical, if
rather despiteful interest in fiction, as the unwelcome supplanter
of poetry in a decadent age; and perhaps he had invited
Newman to write a story as Newman had invited him to
dream of the Indian Bishopric: all <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad majorem Dei gloriam</i>.
At any rate, five weeks before, Froude had mentioned what is
apparently the same ‘novel’ as his own affair, in a letter to
Newman printed in the <cite>Remains</cite> but not in the Newman
<cite>Correspondence</cite>. ‘My ideas about the novel,’ he says, ‘are
but cloudy, as I have no books of reference to get details out
of. Would that the stars may let me return to Oxford before
long, to work at things,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_243" id="fnanchor_243"></a><a href="#footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></span> and rub up my intellects!’ It would
be pleasant, were there any sure grounds for it, to associate
the profound spiritual passion, as Mr. R. H. Hutton calls it,
of <cite>Callista</cite>, with the emulating and holy friendship of John
Henry Newman and Hurrell Froude.</p>

<p>Newman had been bringing forward in print something
very dear to both: the monastic ideal. With his usual
scrupulousness, he had begun to fear that he was laying too
great a burden upon his well-wishers in leaving them to accept
and defend a thesis so inexpedient, because so hostile to the
spirit of the time; and Hurrell strikes out against the expressed
misgiving before ending the letter of July 31 just quoted.
His father, as ever, was his standard of wise moderation.</p>

<p>‘… As to your Monasticism articles in <cite>The British
Magazine</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_244" id="fnanchor_244"></a><a href="#footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></span> my father read the offensive part in the June
<!--216.png--><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pageno">182</span>
one, and could see nothing in it that any reasonable person
could object to; and some persons I know have been struck
by them. I cannot see the harm of losing influence with
people when you can only retain it by sinking the points on
which you differ with them. Surely that would be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Propter
vitam vivendi</i>, etc.? What is the good of influence except
to influence people?’ To Mr. Keble, at the same time,
Froude expresses a generous envy of Newman’s ‘taking’
utterance (what Newman himself calls his ‘mere rhetorical or
histrionic power’), and admits again the difficulty of winning
any such command over souls in England, with his own very
elliptical genius. ‘I find myself so ignorant of the way to
get at people, that I never know what to assume and what to
prove!’ Froude’s straightforward case was Jeremy Taylor’s
of old, of whom Chillingworth regretfully said: ‘Hee wants
much of the ethickall part of a Discourser, and slights too much,
many times, the Arguments of those hee discourses with.’</p>

<p>Newman tells his dear sister Jemima, on August 9: ‘I
think I shall go down to Froude for ten days. I am very
unwilling to do it; but it is so uncertain whether he will be
able to come to Oxford at all, that I think I ought to secure
seeing him before he goes abroad.’ And again, to the absent
comrade, a fortnight after: ‘I am sick of expecting a letter;
for the last week I have every day made sure of one, and been
disappointed. I cannot help fearing you are not well…. I
must (so be it!) come down to you before Vacation ends, to get
some light struck out by collision.’ For Newman had been
trying to work out alone ‘whether Tradition is ever considered
by the Fathers, in matters of faith, more than interpretative of
Scripture.’ To Mr. Rogers, at the same time, he speaks of the
contemplated move. ‘I have little to show, this Vacation, in
point of work done. The time seems to have slipped away in
a dream. Perhaps it would be as well to go down to Froude,
were it only to adjust my notions to his. Dear fellow! long
as I have anticipated what I suppose must come, I feel quite
raw and unprepared. I suppose one ought to get as much as
one can from him, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dum licet</i>.’</p>

<p>Newman himself was again over-busied and ailing. No
reader can fail to notice the deepening tenderness of the
<!--217.png--><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pageno">183</span>
correspondence between the two during these last months, where
yet sportiveness and candour, and a certain mutual deference,
keep their old due order. Words go quickly and lightly,
without emphasis or strain, as if driven willingly on the rising
wind which is the eternal silence.</p>

<p>‘My dearest Newman,’ opens the awaited missive of Sept.
3, ‘I am afraid you will have been grumbling in your heart
at me…. But really, I am not to blame, as I have not put
pen to paper for a fortnight, except yesterday, when I began a
letter to you upside down. I cannot explain what has been the
matter with me; but I am sure that the apothecary into whose
hands I fell made a fool of himself…. As to our controversies,
you are now taking fresh ground, without owning, as
you ought, that on our first basis I dished you! Of course,
if the Fathers maintain that “nothing not deducible from
Scripture ought to be insisted on as terms of communion,” I
have nothing more to say. But again, if you allow Tradition
an interpretative authority, I cannot see what is gained. For
surely the doctrines of the Priesthood and the Eucharist
may be proved from Scripture interpreted by Tradition; and
if so, what is to hinder our insisting on them as terms of
communion? I don’t mean, of course, that this will bear out
the Romanists (which is perhaps your only point?), but it
certainly would bear out our party in excommunicating
Protestants…. You lug in the Apostles’ Creed, and talk
about expansions. What is the end of expansions? Will not
the Romanists say that their whole system is an expansion of
the Holy Catholic Church and the Communion of Saints?’</p>

<p>Finally, on the 10th, arrives Newman’s definite word:
‘I propose coming to you next week,’ coupled with anxious
inquiries about his health. Hurrell replies at once:</p>

<p>‘We shall be ready for you whenever you come. Dr.
[Yonge] and a young doctor called Hinkson, who has paid
much attention to the stethoscope, examined my chest all
over; and they both told my father they never examined a
chest in which there was more complete freedom from bad
symptoms. Yet they say the disorder in my throat is
dangerous unless stopped. Dr. Yonge is decided that I am
not to go abroad this winter.’</p>

<p><!--218.png--><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pageno">184</span>
Newman reached Dartington on the 15th, and was most
happy there, among scenes and faces ‘loved long since,’ for
nearly a month. Every one who has ever come across it
remembers the phrase in which he briefly sums up the end
of the visit: ‘I left, and took my last farewell of R. H. F. on
Sunday, October 11, in the evening, sleeping at Exeter.
When I took leave of him his face lighted up, and almost
shone in the darkness, as if to say that in this world we were
parting for ever.’ The angel, the ‘beautiful young man
girded,’ who knew well ‘the way to the country of the Medes,’
had turned homewards, his mission over, and was to walk with
Tobit no more.</p>

<p>Travel was an unconscionably slow business then, especially
in the south-west. On the following Thursday Newman wrote
from Southampton to Mr. Rogers at Oriel:</p>

<p>‘I have just got here from Lyndhurst, and find the Oxford
coach full. Nothing therefore is left for me but to go up to
London, and try to get to Oxford in that way. Be so good as
to make my excuses to College for my non-appearance: it is the
first time, I believe, I ever was away any day of an Audit,
(except when abroad) since I have been Fellow. I trust I
shall be with you to-morrow.</p>

<p>‘Dear Froude is pretty well, but is languishing for want of
his Oxford contubernians. I trust I have been of use, in this
way, in stimulating his spirits. So strongly do I feel this,
from what I see and hear of him, that I mean almost to make
myself responsible for some intimate going down to him at
Christmas. He is allowed to read now, which is a great
comfort. I am to send him a lot of books. It is wonderful,
almost mysterious, that he should remain so long just afloat,
and as far as it is mysterious, it is hopeful. Really, it would
seem as if he were kept alive by the uplifted hands of Moses:
which is an encouragement to persevere [in prayer].’</p>

<p>The delayed traveller wrote to Hurrell the day after his
arrival at Oxford:</p>

<p class="quotesig">‘<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Luke’s Day, 1835.</p>

<p>‘I have been obliged to come round by London, and having
business there, I did not regret it. Rivington will publish a
<!--219.png--><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pageno">185</span>
third volume [of <cite>Sermons</cite>]; and please will you manage to get
for me your father’s leave to dedicate it, in a few words, to
him? Keble was married on the 10th, and told no one.
The College has but heard from him that he resigns his
Fellowship on that day, without a year of grace.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_245" id="fnanchor_245"></a><a href="#footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></span> I engage to
undertake and pledge myself to provide a visitor for you next
Christmas: Rogers, or [Tom] Mozley, or Williams. But if no
one comes, I shall come myself, which would be too great a
pleasure: for I cannot put into words, or rather I do not
realise to myself, how much the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genius loci</i> of Dartington
Parsonage draws. I could be very foolish did I allow myself!
All my own reminiscences of the place are sad, and I am
almost debarred from them; and I seem to have no right,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alienigena</i>, to intrude elsewhere.’</p>

<p>Newman adds his parenthesis long, long after. ‘This
feeling is expressed in the verses I wrote on my first visit to
Dartington, in 1831:</p>

<p class="center small">‘There strayed awhile, amid the woods of Dart.</p>

<p>I have never seen Dartington since I saw Hurrell there.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_246" id="fnanchor_246"></a><a href="#footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></span>
He shared to the full, as we have seen, Hurrell’s own passion
for the place, a place even yet, despite the profane railway along
the very bank of the Dart, of romance and peace; but he
held his dedicated heart aloof from it in 1835 as in 1831, as
a passage in a letter to his elder sister shows: ‘This country
[Devon], is certainly overpoweringly beautiful and enchanting,
except to those who are resolved not to be enchanted.’</p>

<p class="p2 center">To the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <span class="smcap">J. H. Newman</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Die Omnium Sanctorum</i>, 1835.</p>

<p>‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carissime</i>: After all this delay I write without being able
to report progress;&mdash;but don’t be hard on me. For a long
time the weather has been so very bad as to confine me entirely
to the house, which has dullified me, partly by its
inherent dulness, and partly by making me rather worse, to
such a degree that, till the last two days, which have rather
revived me, I have been up to little more than thinking in my
<!--220.png--><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pageno">186</span>
arm-chair, or listening to a novel. Yesterday I got a drive,
and to-day a ride, which I hope have done me good; and if
I can go on so for a week, I shall be as well as when you
went, I have no doubt; and in a diligent humour I am willing
to hope…. Don’t be conceited if I tell you how much you
are missed here in many quarters. Now you are gone, I
clearly see that a step has been gained. Even I come in for
my share of the benefit, in finding myself partially extricated
from an unenviable position hitherto occupied by me: that of
a prophet in his own country….</p>

<p>‘Before I finish this, I must enter another protest against
your cursing and swearing<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_247" id="fnanchor_247"></a><a href="#footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></span> [at the end of the first <cite>Via
Media</cite>] as you do. What good can it do?&mdash;and I call it
uncharitable to an excess. How mistaken we may ourselves
be on many points that are only gradually opening on us!
Surely you should reserve “blasphemous,” “impious,” etc., for
denial of the articles of the Faith.’</p>

<p>This latter passage is well known from its incorporation in
the <cite>Apologia</cite>. Again, Hurrell resumes on the 15th:</p>

<p>‘You will be in a rage with me when I tell you I have not
answered [Boone].<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_248" id="fnanchor_248"></a><a href="#footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></span> If I was sure of being able to think and
write whenever I chose, I should not have hesitated for a
moment to promise the [article] in a week or two. But this
is far from my case; and I was in a particularly do-nothing
way, the day I got your letter. I don’t know whether you
know the sensation of a pulse above 100°? If you do, I think
you will admit it not to be favourable to mental exertion. So
you see I can’t count on myself, or make promises, and wish
much I was not committed at all. As to the review of Blanco
White, it is an amusement to me, for which I am grateful to
you; but being tied up about time, correcting the proofs,
etc., are my bothers. I may, indeed, be up to business-like
work soon, and I hope I shall; but I am no prophet. So I
have almost a mind to tell Boone that I will let it stand over
till the next.’</p>

<p>Newman’s instant reply was reassuring:</p>

<p><!--221.png--><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pageno">187</span>
‘… I shall write to Boone to-night to tell him that you
think you could not get the article done in time for January.
I will take it through the press, if you will trust me. Do
not fuss yourself, or think yourself pledged….</p>

<p>‘Keble was thrown from his horse, and broke a small bone
in his shoulder, but is better. He will not be editor of the
<cite>Tracts</cite>….</p>

<p>‘M. Bunsen has pronounced upon our views, gathered from
the <cite>Arians</cite> (!), with singular vehemence. He says that if we
succeed, we shall be introducing Popery without authority,
Protestantism without liberty, Catholicism without universality,
and Evangelism without spirituality. In the greater part of
which censure you doubtless agree!’</p>

<p>The all-but-dying invalid finished the long, able, dispassionate
review, entitled ‘Mr. Blanco White: Heresy and Orthodoxy,’
for the printers. It appeared in time, in <cite>The British Critic</cite> for
January, 1836. It ends: ‘We must now, however, leave our
argument imperfect, hoping very shortly to recur to it.’ This
is the colophon from Hurrell Froude. It is diligent and
collected, and keeps the colours boldly flying after a fashion
wholly characteristic. The manuscripts went in sections to
Newman.</p>

<p>‘In the last five days I have written forty of the enclosed
sixty-three pages. If the humour lasts, I may do the rest in a
jiffy. I have spent a week with Dr. Yonge…. [He] was not
satisfied with the effect of steel, and changed it for I know not
what, three days ago; since when I am decidedly stronger.
But the Bishop of Llandaff<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_249" id="fnanchor_249"></a><a href="#footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></span> has warned us against confounding
succession with causation. If Rogers will bring my Breviary,
I shall be obliged. I shall be delighted if Mozley comes with
him. They will meet Wilson, though but for a day.’</p>

<p>The Breviary is the celebrated identical book, first studied
under Blanco White’s direction, the history of which is briefly
given in the <cite>Apologia</cite>, and which is, to Dr. Abbott, so important
an agent in determining Newman’s after-career. It may be
assumed that Mr. Rogers forgot to take it, that Christmastide,
to Dartington, as it was on the shelves of Hurrell’s rooms at
Oriel when he died, and when Archdeacon Froude asked Newman
<!--222.png--><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="pageno">188</span>
to choose a keepsake there. It is still at the Oratory in
Edgbaston.</p>

<p class="p2">A long letter to Newman from the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> R. F. Wilson, on
Dec. 19, contained, incidentally, no very cheery news of their
friend, succumbing to consumption of the throat.</p>

<p>‘It was a great pleasure to me to meet poor Froude, though
he looks sadly, and without any abatement of those symptoms
which must make his friends most anxious about him, appears
weaker [by] a great deal than when he was in Oxford. To me,
he was a more interesting person than ever, because I find that
his peculiar way of thinking, and manner of expressing himself,
which I thought might only belong to him in health and strength,
continue just the same. I saw also Rogers there, for a day.’</p>

<p>Froude himself ‘continues just the same,’ on paper. He
was busily hoisting sail in the offing, and quite calm about
it. ‘I don’t know that it does one any harm,’ he had written
eighteen months before, ‘to have the impression brought
seriously before one that one is not to see out the changes
which seem to be at hand.’</p>

<p>He keeps on rallying Newman in his old animated strain,
on <abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 21, winning the quick official contradiction: ‘As to
our being out of joint here! No, no; we are doing well.’</p>

<p>‘By Rogers’ account, things don’t go exactly as they ought
at Oxford. Golius<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_250" id="fnanchor_250"></a><a href="#footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></span> has rebelled, he says; and Ben Harrison<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_251" id="fnanchor_251"></a><a href="#footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></span>
has jibbed; and the Theological meetings go flat; and old
Mozley<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_252" id="fnanchor_252"></a><a href="#footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></span> won’t work. Harpsfield is the writer on the Breviary
services whose name I could not remember. Rogers says that
Sancta Clara is rich. Wilson,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_253" id="fnanchor_253"></a><a href="#footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></span> for your comfort, is much less
tender in the finger’s end than he was last spring, though I
hear Keble does complain of his being rather soft. I very
much wish to hear of your putting into execution your plan of
a campaign in London, and enlarging the basis of operations.</p>

<p><!--223.png--><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pageno">189</span>
‘… When you write, tell me if you think there was any
of the “nasty irony”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_254" id="fnanchor_254"></a><a href="#footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></span> you used to complain of? I tried to
avoid it…. I am entirely confined to the house, which we
succeed in keeping very warm, though out-of-doors it is a sharp
windy frost.’</p>

<p class="p2">Frederic Rogers wrote to Newman from Dartington,
where, according to Newman’s arrangement, he was spending
Christmas with Hurrell:</p>

<p>‘I am excessively amused at the alternations of treatment
Miss Froude is subject to from Hurrell and Mr. B[ogue].<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_255" id="fnanchor_255"></a><a href="#footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></span> In
fact, I can hardly help being in a constant half-laughter when
anything is going on between Froude and his sister.’</p>

<p>‘Mary Froude,’ adds Newman’s annotating hand in or
about 1860, ‘was one of the sweetest girls I ever saw. She
was at this time engaged to Mr. B[ogue]. He used to come
with a great consciousness of his situation, much gravity, and
great reverence for her. Hurrell, on the other hand, treated
his sister, in a good-humoured way, as a little child, calling her
“Poll,” and sending her about on messages, etc., to Mr. B[ogue’s]
seeming scandal and distress. Mary Froude all the while
was the very picture of naturalness and simplicity, receiving
with equal readiness and equability the homage of the one,
and the playful rudeness of the other.’ Mr. Bogue won his
bride only to lose her. Her strength had been greatly
impaired by her devoted attendance on her favourite brother;
nor did she long outlive him. She was the youngest of
Archdeacon Froude’s three daughters. The inscription over the
vault in the old beautiful churchyard next Dartington Hall, on
the slope of the hill, thus includes her name:</p>

<p>‘Also Mary Isabella Froude, wife of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Richard
Bogue, [who] died August 7, 1836, in her 22nd year.’</p>

<p>Shortly after the loss of his young wife, Mr. Bogue bought
the patronage of Denbury from the Duke of Bedford, and
enlarged the old Rectory House. He was Curate there for
a good while to Archdeacon Froude.</p>

<p><!--224.png--><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pageno">190</span>
‘The most important year in the history of the Oxford
Movement was the year 1836,’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_256" id="fnanchor_256"></a><a href="#footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></span> the Hampden year. The
great fight at Arques was coming on, with ‘brave Crillon’ far
away. Newman duly wished a Happy New Year to Hurrell
at Dartington. Sadly welcome are such conventions, when
nothing less may be said, and nothing more can be said. He
sends divers comments, with a postscript: ‘T. Mozley cannot
come to you. His brother is going to marry my younger
sister.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_257" id="fnanchor_257"></a><a href="#footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></span> There was the usual prompt answer, touching on the
testimonial to Wellington, then Chancellor of the University, as
‘abominable’ and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">doctrinaire</i>; and on the 16th Mr. Rogers
wrote from Bridehead, as he knew well that Newman would
be anxious for personal news, as soon as might be:</p>

<p>‘I have left Froude, who professes to remain much as he
has been, rather weaker than when you were with him, from
never being in the open air, but not worse than he has been
from the beginning of his confinement. I am afraid, too, he is
not quite in such good spirits as he used to be. You ought to
send Harrison down to him, to take lessons on the subject of
the Reformers; for certainly he has a way of speaking which
carries conviction in a very extraordinary way, over and above
the arguments he uses. Did Froude tell you that some good
lady who has read you wonders how it is that you and Arnold
should have any difference between you, your sentiments and
general tone so perfectly agreeing? (!)’</p>

<p>As the young host at Dartington had always loved the
younger guest, it is natural to find the praises of the latter in
Froude’s notes to Newman. Thus on <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 12: ‘Rogers
leaves us on Thursday, having been the greatest of
acquisitions, in the eyes of everyone.’ ‘The greatest of
acquisitions’ of course meant an acquisition to the Cause:
Mr. Rogers’ own worth being properly valued, and that
valuation added as so much credit to local impressions of the
<!--225.png--><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><span class="pageno">191</span>
Movement. Hurrell had no merely social triumphs in mind.
He had paid Newman, as guest and passive proselytiser, the
same compliment.</p>

<p>Again: ‘R[ogers] left us on [Thursday]. We had many
arguments and proses,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_258" id="fnanchor_258"></a><a href="#footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></span> in the former of which he was generally
victorious, but in the latter I think I may boast of having
succeeded. I do believe he hates the meagreness of Protestantism
as much as either of us.’</p>

<p class="p2">One who had never spared himself scrutiny and blame
could, without affectation, arraign his dying languor as ‘selfishness’
and ‘idleness.’ Poor Hurrell’s capacity for work and
perseverance had always been on the heroic scale. ‘These are
not times,’ he had written in 1831, ‘in which people who think
their own principles right have any business to be shilly-shally
… [but] times when it seems almost a sin to be jolly.’
Newman knew how to cheer on that astounding energy,
though with an aching heart.</p>

<p class="p2 center">To the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <span class="smcap">John Keble</span>, <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 7, 1836.</p>

<p>‘I am quite ashamed to think how long it is since I
got your last letter; but illness makes one selfish, at least
mine does, and dislike of writing, or in fact of doing anything,
except trying to keep myself as comfortable as possible,
has become a ruling passion. Since autumn set in I have done
actually nothing except that review of B. White, which
N[ewman] committed me about in such a way that I could not
back out, and so was forced to go forward whether I would or
not. However, I hope to turn over a new leaf as the weather
mends, and indeed I begin to feel its reviving influence already.
It is now more than two months since I have been out of
doors, except in a close carriage, and for the last three weeks
I have not been out at all, but have lived in an artificial
summer at about the temperature of sixty-five degrees….
I am also prohibited altogether from eating meat, poultry, etc.,
or any animal food except fish, which, considering that milk
does not agree with me, makes my case rather a hard one.
<!--226.png--><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="pageno">192</span>
On the whole, however, I am very comfortable, if it was not
for an occasional twinge of conscience at my total idleness, for
which I fear I really have no excuse, as I did not find myself
a bit worse when obliged for a week to work as hard as I could
for <cite>The British Critic</cite>. N[ewman] is now trying to hook me
in for something else in the same line, and though I doubt not
I shall be provoked with myself for having agreed to it, when
the time for delivering the <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> draws near, yet I really think
that the stimulus is a good thing for me. I am really very
much obliged to you for your compliments about Becket,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_259" id="fnanchor_259"></a><a href="#footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></span> for
they really are the only ones I get in any quarter.’</p>

<p class="p2">There was no longer the least hope for a patient who had
inherited consumption; who had never taken care of himself;
whom no change of climate had ever benefited; whose long
austerities had done, no doubt, their share of the work. As it
was, he had entered his thirty-third year, outliving several of
his family. But the treatment to which he was subjected
seems radically wrong to those who glory in hygienic science
revolutionised since his day. The hot climate, the low diet, the
extra clothing while in England, the atrocious dumb-bell
exercise, instead of a gentle and uniform strengthening of
every muscle in the body, and last of all, the deprivation of
fresh air, his one possible alleviation, were so many superfluous
death-wounds in the fight. Mr. Keble, like Mr. Rogers and
Newman, deplored the shut windows at Dartington, remembering
their friend’s lifelong predilection for the open.
‘I am sorry to find they think it necessary to confine him so,’
he sighs to Newman. And then he adds, with a whipped-up
miscellaneous optimism: ‘His being able to write is an excellent
sign. What have you set him on now?… Thank you
for sending me Wilson’s letter: it shows him in a most amiable
light. You have all of you made much more than I meant
out of that little word of mine of his being “softish.” I only
meant that he was not as disposed to hang all Whigs, Puritans,
<!--227.png--><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pageno">193</span>
etc., as some might be; but this we charitably attribute to the
bad company he has kept in London.’</p>

<p>From Oriel Hurrell had, every few days, a full journal of the
party’s doings, interspersed with all manner of private and
autobiographical references. Newman, dining with a celebrated
Evangelical (Mr., afterwards Sir James Stephen), sketches in
the latter’s instructive conversation. ‘It is so hard to [repeat]
without seeming to bepraise myself; but since I am conscious
I have got all my best things from Keble and you, I feel, ever,
something of an awkward guilt when I am lauded for my discoveries.
He did not like my <cite>Arians</cite>, which, if I understood
him, jumped about from one subject to another, and was
hastily written, though thought out carefully…. He seemed
to treat with utter scorn the notion that we were favouring
Popery: this age of Mammon and this shrewd-minded nation
were in no danger of it…. Further, the most subtle enemy
which Christianity has ever had was Benthamism. Now he
thought our views had in them that which could grapple with
it…. He wanted from me a new philosophy…. Indeed, go
where I will, “the fields are ready for harvest,” and none to
reap them. If I might choose my place in the Church, I
would, as far as I can see, be Master of the Temple. I am
sure, from what little I have seen of the young lawyers, I could
do something with them. You and Keble are the philosophers,
and I the rhetorician’ … the fascinating miscellany of a letter
goes on. And another quickly follows, when the writer (who
had been named to Lord Melbourne as well as Keble) fears
that Keble will refuse the Divinity Professorship at Oxford if it
be proffered him, and flies to Froude as to one who can help
to prevent that calamity. ‘I dread lest he should decline it.
I write to you, that if you agree with me, you may write to
him at once. For myself, I should go by your judgement, if
such a thing occurred to me…. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carissime</i>, I think I may say
with a clear conscience I have no desire for it, and, had I my
choice, would decide that the offer should not be made to me.
I am too indolent, and like my own way too well, to wish it.
I should be entangled in routine business, which I abhor. I
should be obliged to economise,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_260" id="fnanchor_260"></a><a href="#footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></span> and play the humbug, in a way
<!--228.png--><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><span class="pageno">194</span>
I should detest, and I have no love for the nuisance of house
and furniture, adding up bills, settling accounts, hiring servants,
and getting up the price of butcher’s meat. I have the
unpopularity, the fame, of being a party man, [with] the care
of Tracts and the engagements of agitation. I am more
useful as I am; but Keble is a light too spiritual and subtle to
be seen unless put upon a candlestick.’ There is a most
affectionate ending to his letter sent to the post on Candlemas
Day. ‘<ins title="Tharsei, philon êtor">Θάρσει, φίλον ἦτορ</ins>. You could not but get weaker
this weather, so confined.’</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hurrell had written ‘the last letter he wrote
to me, perhaps the last letter he wrote at all.’ It is dated
<abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 27, 1836; the flow of it, the wonted pace, is gallant as
usual, though it held both serious criticism and sad news.
‘You may perhaps have seen in the papers,’ he says to
Newman, that my grandmother died, the 14th of this month.
She retained her faculties to the last, and seems to have
undergone the minimum of suffering which death requires.
She was within a month or two of eighty-nine.’ This was his
father’s mother, Phillis Hurrell.</p>

<p>‘It is very encouraging about the Oxford Tracts, but I
wish I could prevail on you, when the second edition comes
out, to cancel or materially alter several. The other day
accidentally put in my way the Tract on “The Apostolical
Succession in the English Church”; and it really does seem
so very unfair, that I wonder you could, even in the extremity
of <ins title="oikonomia">οἰκονομία</ins> and <ins title="phenakismos">φενακισμὸς</ins> have consented to be a party to
it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_261" id="fnanchor_261"></a><a href="#footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></span> The Patriarchate of Constantinople, as everyone knows,
was not one “from the first,” but neighbouring Churches
voluntarily submitted to it, in the first instance, and then by
virtue of their oaths remained its ecclesiastical subjects; and
the same argument by which you justify England and Ireland
would justify all those Churches in setting up any day for
themselves. The obvious meaning of the canon [of Ephesus]
is that Patriarchs might not <em>begin</em> to exercise authority in
Churches <em>hitherto</em> independent, without their consent.</p>

<p><!--229.png--><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pageno">195</span>
‘Christie tells me you have had a letter from poor
Blanco White, pleased rather than otherwise with [my]
review,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_262" id="fnanchor_262"></a><a href="#footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></span> and mistaking it for yours, and sending you a copy of
the book. Poor fellow: I should much like to know in what
tone he wrote; it must have been a painful thing answering
him…. I don’t gain flesh, in spite of all the milk. Indeed,
I suspect that in the last six weeks I have lost a good deal,
but the symptoms remain the same.’ It is in this letter that
Froude arranges for the continued dedication of the accumulated
dues from his own Fellowship to the propagation of the
Cause dear to his heart. ‘So spend away, my boy,’ he calls
cheerfully to Newman, ‘and make a great fuss, as if your money
flowed in from a variety of sources!’ It was his valediction.</p>

<p>Archdeacon Froude, early in February, leaves a blank on
the last page of his communication to Newman, ‘for your
regular correspondent to fill.’ Then comes the ominous postscript:
‘Hurrell wishes me to say that he has nothing
particular to say just now, but that you shall hear from him in
three or four days. He has received your two letters. And
now (as he will not ask to see what I may write), I will tell
you in a few words that my fears for him have increased
considerably within the last week. There can be now no
doubt that he has been losing ground, that he is much thinner
than when Mr. Rogers left us, and as evidently weaker…. He
is generally cheerful, sleeps well, and takes a sufficient quantity
of food.’</p>

<p>Newman’s thirty-fifth birthday came on February 21,
and upon that day, absorbed as he now became in fighting
Hampdenism, he penned a loving letter of ‘long, long
thoughts’ to his favourite sister Jemima, betrothed to John
Mozley. ‘Thank my Mother and Harriet for their congratulations
upon this day. They will be deserved, if God gives me
grace to fulfil the purposes for which He has led me on hitherto
in a wonderful way. I think I am conscious to myself that,
whatever are my faults, I wish to live and die to His glory; to
surrender wholly to Him as His instrument, to whatever work,
and at whatever personal sacrifice, (though I cannot duly
<!--230.png--><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pageno">196</span>
realise my own words when I say so). He is teaching me, it
would seem, to depend on Him only; for, as perhaps Rogers
told you, I am soon to lose dear Froude: which, looking
forward to the next twenty-five years of my life, and its
probable occupations, is the greatest loss I could have. I
shall be truly widowed; yet I hope to bear it lightly.’</p>

<p>At intervals of five days, Archdeacon Froude gave Newman
his melancholy bulletin. Nowhere is he more admirable
than in facing the impending loss of the son who had come to
be his pride and glory, and his bosom friend. Says the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Thomas Mozley: ‘There was a sort of stoicism about Archdeacon
Froude’s character which sometimes surprised those
who had only seen him for a day or two, conversing, or
sketching, or sight-seeing. He once rather shocked his clergy
by delivering a Charge while a very dear daughter was lying
dead in his house: but there was a romantic conception of
duty in the act which affords some key to Richard Hurrell’s
character.’</p>

<p class="quotesig"><abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 18, 1836.</p>

<p>‘My dear Hurrell desires me to account to you for his long
silence, but … I am sure you must have attributed it to
the real cause, and be prepared for a confirmation of the fears
I then expressed…. All hope of his recovery is gone; but
we have the comfort of seeing him quite free from pain, and
in sure trust that the change will be a happy one whenever it
shall please God to take him. His thoughts continually turn
to Oxford, to yourself, and Mr. Keble; but my heart is too
full to add more than his instructions to thank you for all you
have written to him, and to say how much he was interested
in Mr. Rogers’ most amusing account of the late proceedings
in the University.’</p>

<p class="quotesig"><abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 23, 1836.</p>

<p>‘Your friend is still alive. The morning after I wrote my
last, he awoke with a fluttering about the heart and a pulsation
at the wrist I could not count. Our apothecary thought he
could not live out the day; but our doctor holds out no hope
of any change having taken place that should raise our expectations
<!--231.png--><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pageno">197</span>
beyond that of a short respite. As he continues free
from pain, or any very uncomfortable sensation except that of
extreme weakness … I am thankful that he is permitted to
remain with us, even for a few days. On no account, my
dear Mr. Newman, would I have you come down: no good
could come of it. You shall hear again from me in a few
days; sooner, if anything occurs that should call for an earlier
communication. Hurrell desires me to thank you, and also to
say that he is “sorry that he has given you any trouble about
those stupid accounts,” to use his own words, and that he
“cannot scrape up ideas and strength enough” to write to
you himself. Should he, (contrary to all reasonable grounds
for hope), get a little about again, do tell Mr. Williams
[that] his paying us a short visit will give us great pleasure
indeed.’</p>

<p class="quotesig"><abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 28, 1836.</p>

<p>‘My dear son died this day. Since my last he has been
gradually but quietly sinking. After a rather more than
usually restless night, he spoke of himself as being quite
comfortable this morning, and appeared to hear the Service
of the day, and a sermon, read to him with so much attention
that I did not think the sad event so near as it has been.
About two o’clock, as I was recommending him to take some
egg and wine, I observed a difficulty in his breathing. He
attempted to speak; and then after a few slight struggles, his
sufferings were at an end.’</p>

<p>He was laid to rest on March 3, beside his mother, brother,
and sister, close to the Church porch. The burial service was
read by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Anthony Buller, a Devonian and an Oriel
man, an old friend who dearly loved him. Apparently neither
Newman nor Keble travelled down for the day to Dartington
Parsonage, though the former, at least, had arranged to do so
from London. But the Archdeacon’s tidings were sent to
Oxford, and it was only on the morning of March 1 that
Newman learned of his loss. It quite overcame him. ‘He
opened the letter in my room,’ writes Thomas Mozley to his
sister, ‘and could only put it into my hand, with no remark.
<!--232.png--><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><span class="pageno">198</span>
He afterwards, Henry Wilberforce told me, lamented with
tears (not a common thing for him), that he could not [have
seen] Froude just to tell him how much he felt that he had
owed to him in the clearing and strengthening of his views.’
Keble, too, at the Hursley Altar, the Sunday after Hurrell’s
home-going, which must have been his own first Sunday there as
Vicar, broke down completely, and for some minutes could not
go on. At Oriel (to overhear again the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> T. Mozley addressing
his brother John): ‘Froude’s death seems not a gloom, but
a calm sadness over the College. Newman showed me his
father’s letter written the same day, perfectly quiet and manly,
making various arrangements, and telling Newman and his
[other] friends to make selections from Froude’s scanty collection
of books, to keep for his sake. I suppose Froude never
got a book or anything else, in his life, merely for the sake of
having it. His absolute indifference to possession was something
marvellous. Did I ever tell you that for two years, at
least, he has given his Fellowship to Newman, to go towards
the <cite>Tracts</cite>? Yet he was by no means careless about money
matters; for he with great pains put the accounts of Junior
Treasurer (which I find troublesome enough even now), on an
entirely new and simpler plan, to the great convenience of his
successor…. I dare say there is no one who has said more
severe and cutting things to me, yet the constant impression
Froude has always left on my mind is that of kindness and
<em>sweetness</em>.’ This testimony, indeed, was general.</p>

<p>On March 2, Newman wrote to his old friend J. W.
Bowden, from Oxford:</p>

<p>‘Yesterday morning brought me the news of Froude’s
death; and if I could collect my thoughts at this moment, I
would say something to you about him; but I scarcely can.
He has been so very dear to me, that it is an effort to me to
reflect on my own thoughts about him. I can never have a
greater loss, looking on for the whole of my life, for he was to
me, and he was likely to be ever, in the same degree of continual
familiarity which I enjoyed with yourself in our undergraduate
days…. It would have been a great satisfaction
to me had you known him. You once saw him, indeed; but
it was when his health was gone, and when you could have no
<!--233.png--><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span class="pageno">199</span>
idea of him. It is very mysterious that anyone so remarkably
and variously gifted, and with talents so fitted for these
times, should be removed. I never, on the whole, fell in with
so gifted a person. In variety and perfection of gifts I think
he far exceeded even Keble. For myself, I cannot describe
what I owe to him as regards the intellectual principles of
religion and morals. It is useless to go on to speak of him:
it has pleased God to take him, in mercy to him, but by a
very heavy visitation to all who were intimate with him. Yet
everything was so bright and beautiful<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_263" id="fnanchor_263"></a><a href="#footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></span> about him, that to
think of him must always be a comfort. The sad feeling I
have is that one cannot retain in one’s memory all one wishes
to keep there; and that as year passes after year, the image
of him will be fainter and fainter.’</p>

<p>The long-memoried man who uttered that was only too
conscious that he had no portrait of his departed friend.</p>

<p>On the 6th, turning aside from other things, Newman says,
in his thrilling undertone, to Keble:</p>

<p>‘… We have indeed had an irreparable loss; but I have
for years expected it. I would fain be his heir. When I was
with him in October, I so wished to drink out his thoughts,
but found they would not flow except in orderly course, as all
God’s gifts. It was an idea of Bowden’s, the other day, that
as time goes on, and more and more Saints are gathered in,
fewer are needed on earth: the City of God has surer and
deeper foundations, day by day.’</p>

<p>Some thought of kindred wing crossed at the same time
the mind of Charlotte Keble at Hursley. ‘I shall be very
glad,’ she says, feelingly, to her sister-in-law Elizabeth on March
9, ‘for poor Mr. Newman to have the comfort of John’s being
in Oxford. He seems very much to need it; and nobody, I
suppose, can so entirely sympathise with him, both in his
distress for the loss, and also in the views and opinions which
knit them all three together. I can’t help thinking (at least,
one doesn’t know), but that Mr. Froude may in some way or
<!--234.png--><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pageno">200</span>
other be of more service now than if he had been kept here
longer.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_264" id="fnanchor_264"></a><a href="#footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps no apology need be made for dwelling on the
impression left by Hurrell Froude on the minds of his comrades,
above all, on the mind of his best-loved comrade, after he had
passed away. This afterglow, this ‘trailing cloud of glory,’
is biographic comment indeed. He had lived so detached a
life that it is pleasant to associate him, at the last, with the
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">schwärmerei</i> of much tender common human sorrow, with sorrow
sure of his own immortal continued interest in all that
he had worked for in England: for it helps to show him less
as an elf and a ‘kinless loon,’ than as the Saint-errant which,
through his thirty-two years, he was.</p>

<p>The heavy blow of his mother’s unexpected death fell on
Newman in May. The association of this loss with the sharp
foregoing one, and the remembrance of Froude, whom he had
known and lived with so happily since they first became colleagues
at Oriel, are palpable enough in the brave sigh of that
greatly religious soul, breathed in a letter to Harriett Newman,
dated June 21, 1836:</p>

<p>‘You have nothing to be uneasy at, so far as I am concerned.
Thank God, my spirits have not sunk, nor will they,
I trust. I have been full of work, and that keeps me generally
free from dejection. If it ever comes, it is never of long
continuance, and is even not unwelcome. I am speaking of
dejection from solitude. I never feel so near Heaven as then.
Years ago, from 1822 to 1826, I used to be very much by
myself, and in anxieties of various kinds which were very
harassing. I then, on the whole, had no friend near me, no
one to whom I opened my mind fully, or who could sympathise
with me. I am but returning, at worst, to that state … and
after all, this life is very short, and it is a better thing to be
pursuing what seems God’s Will than to be looking after one’s
own comfort. I am learning more than hitherto to live in the
presence of the dead: this is a gain which strange faces cannot
take away.’</p>

<p>Less than a year later, a similar strain comes like a music
of triumph over sorrow in such a letter to Frederic Rogers,
<!--235.png--><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pageno">201</span>
on the death of his sister, as none but Newman could
write:</p>

<p>‘This is only a fresh instance of what I suppose one must
make up one’s mind to think, and what is consoling to think,
that those who are early taken away are the fittest to be taken,
and that it is a privilege so to be taken, and that they are in
their proper place when taken. Surely God would not separate
from us such, except it were best both for them and for us;
and that those who are taken away are such as are most acceptable
to Him seems proved by what we see: for scarcely do
you hear of some especial instance of religious excellence, but
you have also cause of apprehension how long such a one is to
continue here…. We pray daily: “Thy Kingdom come”: if we
understand our words, we mean it as a privilege to leave
the world, and we must not wonder that God grants the privilege
to some of those who pray for it, … pray for our
eventual re-gathering, but our dispersion in the interval. The
more we live in the world that is not seen, the more shall we
feel that the removal of friends into that unseen world is a
bringing them near to us, not a separation. Our Saviour’s
going brought Him nearer, though invisibly, in the Spirit.’ It
is all reticent and impersonal, but it rises, before his great
battle begins, from Newman’s stricken lonely heart. ‘Thou
doomed to die,’ as he had said, long before, in his poem, ‘David
and Jonathan’:</p>

<div class="poem-container no-break">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0a">‘Thou doomed to die: he on us to impress</div>
  <div class="i0">The portent of a blood-stained holiness.’</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p class="unindent">Last of all, come from his half-unwilling hand the lines well-known
to students of sacred verse.</p>

<div class="poem-container no-break">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0a">‘Dearest! he longs to speak, as I to know:</div>
  <div class="i0">And yet we both refrain.’</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>What beauty is in that word ‘refrain,’ a filament of English
feeling kept between the quick and the dead! It occurs in a
little afterthought of a stanza, which was the only poetic
offering of Newman’s pen to Hurrell Froude gone.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_265" id="fnanchor_265"></a><a href="#footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></span> Never was
there so imponderable an obituary; nor ever any more
exquisitely in keeping.</p>

<p><!--236.png--><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a><span class="pageno">202</span>
For ‘the rest’ was indeed ‘silence.’ A proposal for a
monument in <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary’s at Oxford, affectionately brought
forward by Robert Wilberforce, as due to ‘our incomparable
friend,’ ‘that invaluable friend,’ somehow fell through. A
special paper for <cite>The British Magazine</cite> fell through too, neither
Newman nor Keble being able, in his first grief, to write it
to his own satisfaction. The only actual notice of Froude’s
decease occurred in a bare alphabetical list printed in the
April number, 1836. ‘Tributes of Respect’ were usual in
the Magazine, but he had none. The <cite>Annual Biographer and
Obituary</cite>, published by the Longmans in 1837, does not include
him. Nor had he any epitaph, not even when Archdeacon
Froude died twenty-three years later, until Dartington Church
was taken down, being thought too remote from the village
population, in 1878, and the stones used in a re-erection close
to the highway below; then the vault was railed in, where it
was left in the lonely grassy space, with only the ancient Hall,
the grey ivied tower, and the sun-dial for solemn neighbours, and
the name and dates of each of the Froude family were cut on
the plain slab. They are unaccompanied even by a text, or a
Christian symbol. And thus, in the abstention which was his
lifelong garment, Hurrell sleeps. On the hundredth anniversary
of his birth, March 25, 1903, a great garland of leaves and
simple Devon blossoms lay there, with a dedicatory good word
from his favourite Book of Daniel: ‘O man greatly beloved!
peace be unto thee: fear not; be strong, yea, be strong…. But
go thou thy way till the end be; for thou shalt rest, and stand
in thy lot at the end of the days.’ It cannot be for ever that
‘Froude of the Movement’ shall lack a less perishable memorial.</p>

<p class="p2">In 1836, the ‘vanishing of such a spirit without sign’ was
not to be endured. It was the most natural thing in the
world that all he had written should be gathered together, that
such a lover of books (as Leigh Hunt says somewhere, in one
of his happy literary retrospects), should himself become a book.
Hurrell became a singular book, as it happened, made up,
paradoxically, of matter never prepared by himself for publication;
and he and it were put forth as a party manifesto. It
may not be uninteresting to review the origin and character of

<abbr title="Master of Arts">M.A.</abbr>, Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford</cite>, printed by the
Rivingtons in 1838 and 1839, and consisting of four volumes
octavo. The Editors, whose names do not appear upon the
title-page, were the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Keble and the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Henry
Newman. The latter is generally supposed to have done
most of the work; there are published letters of Keble’s to
Sir John Coleridge, and of Newman’s to Mr. Frederic Rogers,
which go to show that the idea of bringing out the <cite>Remains</cite>,
and the initiatory labour, including the first Preface, were
Newman’s. But according to Coleridge’s <cite>Memoir</cite>, Mr. Keble,
as collaborator, wrote by far the greater part of both Prefaces.
For the very beautiful second one he was certainly responsible.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_266" id="fnanchor_266"></a><a href="#footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Of Part <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> of these <cite>Remains</cite>, <abbr title="Volume one">Vol. i.</abbr> is devoted to a Private
Journal; Memoranda personal and philosophical; Letters to
Friends; one Latin and five English poems; seven pages of
remembered miscellaneous sayings; and a diary as Appendix.
The companion volume is devoted to Sermons complete and
fragmentary; three Essays on subjects connected with arts
and sciences, and three on subjects purely ecclesiastical.
Part <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></span>, <abbr title="Volume one">Vol. i.</abbr>, has five papers and some fragments, none of
which are on secular themes; and the final volume is given up
to the History of the Contest between Thomas à Becket,
Archbishop of Canterbury, and Henry <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></span>, drawn from original
documents and State Papers, left unfinished by Hurrell Froude,
and carried on and edited by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> James Bowling Mozley.</p>

<p>The collecting of ‘dearest Froude’s papers’ had begun
before April, 1836; they were looked over at Hursley in July;
by September, Newman, otherwise busy as he was, writes that
he is getting on with the transcriptions, and that James Mozley
has been hard at work during the whole Vacation on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Thomas of Canterbury. Archdeacon Froude sends up his
auxiliary supplies in October, from Dartington Parsonage.</p>

<p>‘… I sent off a parcel to you, three days ago, by Henry
Champernowne: it contains the text of dear Hurrell’s manuscripts.
<!--240.png--><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><span class="pageno">204</span>
All your letters to him that I can find are also
enclosed. With the latter I must confess I have not parted
without regret. They are memorials of your affectionate friendship
with one whose image is ever before me, and to which I could
never turn without a delightful interest that I cannot describe.
His correspondence for many years with myself<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_267" id="fnanchor_267"></a><a href="#footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></span> turns principally
on little passing incidents, or relates to matters of private
concern; but it is of great value to me as a sort of journal
from early boyhood nearly to the time of our separation.’</p>

<p><cite>Lyra Apostolica</cite> was issued in November, and several of the
critics had taken pains to single out ‘<ins title="beta">β</ins>’s’ poems for special
commendation, even if at the expense of Keble and Newman:
certainly Samuel Wilberforce did so, in his asked-for review,
the tone of which was so disconcerting and unexpected to
the asker;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_268" id="fnanchor_268"></a><a href="#footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></span> and <cite>The Christian Observer</cite> had saluted Hurrell
as ‘the most spiritual and least bigoted of the whole set.’
All this was encouraging to the projectors of the <cite>Remains</cite>,
who knew better than outsiders of how keen and high an
intellect, how holy an inspiration, their cause had been
deprived. Newman’s notes, as the editing progressed, are
very sanguine.</p>

<p class="p2 center">To the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <span class="smcap">John Keble</span>, June 30, 1837.</p>

<p>‘… I have transcribed [R. H. F.’s] Private Thoughts, and
am deeply impressed with their attractive character. They are
full of instruction and interest, as I think all will feel. I have
transcribed them for your imprimatur. If you say Yes, send
them to me; I propose to go to press almost immediately.
These Thoughts present a remarkable instance of the
temptation to rationalism, self-speculation, etc., subdued. We
see his mind only breaking out into more original and beautiful
discoveries, from that very repression which, at first sight,
seemed likely to be the utter prohibition to exercise his special
powers. He used playfully to say that his “highest ambition
was to be a humdrum,” and by relinquishing the prospect of
originality he has but become the more original.’</p>

<p><!--241.png--><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><span class="pageno">205</span>
On July 5, Newman gives to Rogers categorical reasons
for his plan of publication.</p>

<p>‘1. To show his … unaffectedness, playfulness, brilliancy,
which nothing else would show. His Letters approach to conversation,
to show his delicate mode of implying, not expressing,
sacred thoughts; his utter hatred of pretence and humbug. I
have much to say on the danger which I think at present
besets the Apostolical Movement of getting peculiar in externals,
<i>i.e.</i>, formal, manneristic. Now Froude disdained all show of
religion. In losing him we have lost an important correction….
His Letters are a second-best preventative.</p>

<p>‘2. To make the work interesting, nothing takes so much
as these private things.</p>

<p>‘3. To show the history of the formation of his opinions.
Vaughan<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_269" id="fnanchor_269"></a><a href="#footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></span> was observing the other day that we never have the
history of men in the most interesting period of their life, from
eighteen to twenty-eight or thirty, while they are forming:
now this gives Froude’s.</p>

<p>‘4. To show how deliberately and dispassionately he formed
his opinions. They were not taken up as mere fancies: this
invests them with much consideration. Here his change from
Tory to Apostolical is curious.</p>

<p>‘5. To show the interesting growth of his mind, how indolence
was overcome, etc.; to show his love of mathematics, his
remarkable struggle against the lassitude of disease, his
working to the last.</p>

<p>‘6. For the intrinsic merit of his remarks.</p>

<p>‘If you think the notion entertainable, I wish you could put
the <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> into the hands of some person who is a good judge,
yet more impartial than ourselves, in order to ascertain his impression
of it…. If you and the other agree in countenancing
the notion, then send down the <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> to Keble, with
an enumeration of [my] reasons for publishing.’</p>

<p class="p2 center">To the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <span class="smcap">John Keble</span>, July 16, 1837.</p>

<p>‘… Williams has suggested the publication of extracts
from Hurrell’s letters. I feared at first they would be too personal
<!--242.png--><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><span class="pageno">206</span>
as regards others; but then I began to think that if they
could be given, they would be next best to talking with him,
and would show him in a light otherwise unattainable. Then
there are so many clever things in those he sent me: the
first hints of principles which I and others have pursued,
and of which he ought to have the credit. Moreover, we
have often said the Movement, if anything comes of it,
must be enthusiastic. Now here is a man fitted above all
others to kindle enthusiasm. I have written to William
Froude about it, who caught at the idea, which he said had
already struck him. Considering the state of the University,
everything which can tell against Hampdenism<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_270" id="fnanchor_270"></a><a href="#footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></span> will be a
gain.’</p>

<p>Newman continued sanguine.</p>

<p class="p2 center">To <span class="smcap">J. W. Bowden</span>, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, Hursley, <abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 6, 1837.</p>

<p>‘… I am here for a week to consult with Keble about
Froude’s papers, which are now in the press, and require a
good deal of attention. You will, I think, be deeply interested
in them. His father has put some into my hands of a most
private nature. They are quite new even to Keble, who
knew more about him than anyone…. All persons of
unhackneyed feelings and youthful minds must be taken
with them; others will think them romantic, scrupulous, over-refined,
etc.’</p>

<p class="p2">The ‘papers of a most private nature’ dated chiefly from
Hurrell’s twenty-third to his twenty-seventh year. ‘They have
taught me,’ Mr. Keble writes to that friend, his own earliest
biographer, whom they were to disturb and shock when once
in print, ‘they have taught me things concerning him which I
never suspected myself, as to the degree of self-denial which he
was practising when I was most intimate with him. This
<!--243.png--><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><span class="pageno">207</span>
encourages me to think that there may be many such whom
one dreams not of.’</p>

<p>How Froude came to leave these secret manuscripts behind
him is not perfectly clear. Mr. Keble had advised burning them,
long before. During the months and even years when there
was natural opportunity for disposing of all his affairs, Froude
had abstained from destroying his papers. The only explanation
is that he was too completely indifferent, in all such matters,
to make a move of any sort. He belonged to a journal-keeping
age and a journal-keeping family: to write, and to dismiss the
writing from memory, were to him easy matters. Neither his
kind of memory, nor his degree of self-attentiveness, would have
helped him to produce an <cite>Apologia</cite>. His diaries, properly
speaking, have absolutely no egotism: he is merely dramatically
concentrated on R. H. F. as a moral ‘dummy’ convenient for
observation and correction, and it was quite in keeping with
his habit that he should have taken no thought whatever of a
testamentary nature, towards the end. He could, of course,
have had no suspicion of the ultimate use to which his confessions
were soon to be put. Besides, he would harbour no fear
of depreciation, but would rather have desired that, even in
the grave.</p>

<p>On the fly-leaf of the finished book they placed a sweet
motto from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Adeste, sanctæ conjuges</i>, the midnight hymn
appointed for the Office of the Commemoration of Holy
Women. It came from the Parisian Breviary, in which Froude
had delighted. Newman was editing the Hymns included in
it at this very time.</p>

<p>The Editors felt, no doubt, that anything like this, for all
of its fitness, would have imported a note of unnecessary defiance.
To print the <cite>Remains</cite> at all was certainly war-cry
enough.</p>

<p>The first Part, comprising two volumes, appeared at mid-winter,
1838. It was much talked of, as was inevitable, among
the interested friends and foes of the High Church party, and
it bred the most contrary impressions. Beyond the familiar
circle, Froude’s comrades and their followers, what success
the book won was a frank <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">succès de scandale</i>. Its one tangible
result was to urge on Low Church zealots to build the Martyrs’
Memorial at Oxford. It was dedicated in 1841; and subconsciously,
it was from plinth to finial what Mr. Keble called
it, ‘a public dissent from Froude.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_271" id="fnanchor_271"></a><a href="#footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></span> Love for Ridley, Latimer,
and the great Cranmer who, as F. Rogers once predicated,
‘burned well,’ were less potent in raising that graceful landmark
than heated disapprobation of Froude, Newman, and
Keble himself. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic vos non vobis.</i> Hurrell liked ironical
situations. Here was one to his hand.</p>

<p>The sale of the <cite>Remains</cite> was never great; in fact, it was so
<!--245.png--><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><span class="pageno">209</span>
restricted that the publishers, about seven months after the
launching of the first Part, made considerable demur before
bringing the second Part out at all. No extra edition was called
for; the work has stood, ever since, among the out-of-print
rarities of London catalogues. Of the mass of writing which it
comprised, sacred or secular, there has been but a single paper
reprinted: the remarkable paper on State Interference in
Matters Spiritual, issued by Selwood in 1869, with a strongly
corroborative Introduction from the pen of that good militant
shepherd, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William J. E. Bennett, Vicar of Frome.</p>

<p>On March 29, 1838, Newman wrote from Oxford to Keble,
on the subject then uppermost in their minds.</p>

<p>‘You must not be vexed to have a somewhat excited letter
from Edward Churton<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_272" id="fnanchor_272"></a><a href="#footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></span> on the subject of dear Hurrell’s
<cite>Remains</cite>. I doubt not, too, you really will not be so. All
persons whose hearts have been with Cranmer and Jewel are
naturally pained; and one must honour them for it. It is the
general opinion here that the Journal ought to have been published,
and is full of instruction. Yesterday morning I had the
following pleasant announcement from William Froude: “My
father is much pleased with Hurrell’s book. He had been
rather alarmed by some comments made upon it in a letter
from Sir John Coleridge; but the book itself has quite reassured
him. The Preface says exactly what one wished to have said.”’</p>

<p>If Archdeacon Froude felt satisfied, that would atone for
much. Mr. Rose’s opinion was next in importance to the
Archdeacon’s, to the Oriel men responsible for this particular
exercise of it. Fortunately, he was sufficiently favourable,
writing to Pusey from King’s College on March 14, 1838, to
ask for ‘an account,’ or ‘a sketch’ of ‘poor Froude’s most
interesting <cite>Remains</cite>. I do not know to whom to give them
for review. For very few can understand or appreciate his
very peculiar excellences. A book so miscellaneous, touching
on so very many points is a very hard matter for a regular
reviewer.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_273" id="fnanchor_273"></a><a href="#footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></span> Apart from these graded expressions of private
<!--246.png--><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a><span class="pageno">210</span>
sympathy, there was censure and even ridicule to bear; and
self-earned troubles are proverbially not the sweetest. Violent
denunciations arose on all sides, and especially within the
bosom of an ungrateful Church. The Lady Margaret
Professor of Divinity fulminated from the very University
pulpit; the Bishop of Ferns and Leighlin, the most persevering
‘charger’ of all, thundered against ‘that very rash and
intemperate young man.’ Even the House of Commons was,
on one occasion at least, disturbed by godly zeal exerted
against the book. To James Mozley, during July, Newman
wrote: ‘You see Lord Morpeth<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_274" id="fnanchor_274"></a><a href="#footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></span> has been upon me in the
House, as editor of the <cite>Remains</cite>. Gladstone has defended me;
Sir R[obert] Inglis the University.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_275" id="fnanchor_275"></a><a href="#footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></span> And Rogers sends his
vivacious message to Newman: ‘What do you think of
Gladstone’s exculpation of you? And what of the face
Froude would have made at being quoted in the House of
Commons as “an accomplished gentleman” by Lord Morpeth?’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_276" id="fnanchor_276"></a><a href="#footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>The <cite>Remains</cite>, quickly as it fell out of print, was a storm-centre.
Mr. Gladstone, concerned with defending the good
faith of the editor-in-chief, yet handled the oppugned work
with repeated regrets.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_277" id="fnanchor_277"></a><a href="#footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></span> He has left it upon record, referring
to an earlier year, and echoing the adjectives of Bishop
O’Brien just quoted: ‘My first impressions and emotions in
connection with [the Oxford Movement] were those of indignation
at what I thought the rash intemperate censures pronounced
by Mr. Hurrell Froude upon the Reformers.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_278" id="fnanchor_278"></a><a href="#footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></span> Newman’s
<cite>Correspondence</cite><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_279" id="fnanchor_279"></a><a href="#footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></span> gives quite a roll-call of the Bishops, editors,
magazines, and private persons ‘opening on us.’ He adds:
‘I can fancy the old Duke sending down to ask the Heads of
Houses whether we cannot be silenced.’</p>

<p>Some who took the <cite>Remains</cite> to heart were more than
half sorry that it was published. The real reasons for that
measure had been in the Prefaces a little obscured, because
<!--247.png--><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pageno">211</span>
largely taken for granted as obvious. So much is clear: the
need had been felt of issuing a book to serve as a dead friend’s
only monument. But the moment one came to handle his
compositions, all warlike, all new, one foresaw the ethical risk
of putting them forward, without first educating a public to
read them. Mr. Wilson, representing his own earliest feeling,
and that of Mr. Keble his Vicar, sympathised, in the very
beginning, with Newman over ‘the great difficulty and perplexity
you must be in at present, as to what course to take….
We cannot afford by any shock even to throw back into
their former upright posture of indifference or suspicion some
who are now leaning our way.’ To publish poor Hurrell at
all turned out a large diplomatic matter. Confident that he
needed only to be known to be loved and trusted, Newman
resolved to make him intimately and unmistakably known,
and his opinions, in consequence, heeded as they deserved.
The <cite>Remains</cite> is almost the first among modern English books
to expose what is sacredly private: we are all used now,
whether with diminishing or undiminishing protest, to exhibitions
of the spiritual anatomy of humankind. The Editors’
challenge to an Erastian world seemed based on the belief that
their cause had bred its perfect flower in Froude, and that
only to show him as he was, with his mighty single-hearted
zest, his aspirations towards holiness, and his playful gentleness,
would be to show also the attaching loveliness of their
cause. They proceeded upon one or two syllogisms which
had no flaw, but also no application. For, plainly, Froude was
impossible to be understanded of the people, and the more he
himself was expounded the worse it was for the system which
he personified. An eminent critic led the way in dwelling,
not on the question so unmistakably thrust forward, of
Præmunire, but on Hurrell’s confessed and repented glance
to see ‘whether goose came on the table at dinner!’ That
goose is well known to a number of contemporary persons
who have never owned a copy of the <cite>Remains</cite>, nor heard
what ascetic theology has to say of such a thing as concupiscence
of the eyes. Hurrell, in a secret hour, had named the
goose only to his guardian angel, between whom and himself
the sense of humour could hardly come into play. Keble’s
<!--248.png--><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pageno">212</span>
humour, and Newman’s likewise, were almost incomparably
keen: one knows not how these passages survived the proofreading.
It was inevitable, however, that public attention
should fasten upon them with disrelish and horror. They
were unusual, they were not ‘self-respecting’; they belonged to
types outgrown and superseded; in short, they were fatally
‘un-English,’ to that most respectable year 1838. It was
bidden to admire a humility and disinterestedness in which it
could not believe. A completely non-sentimental religion was
a trying spectacle, even to the most religious among Early
Victorian readers. A young man ever accusing himself, a
young man waiving his own profit, and doing these monstrous
things by force of will and habit, all his life, was simply an
offence to common morals. Natural virtues are well enough:
truth, industry, ambition, family affection, are at least legal:
they are not a slap in the face to what is called a Christian
community. But a temper fed from hidden springs, and full
of austerity and detachment, must ever look to the mass of
men like an alien thing, the outcome of hypocrisy or sheer
foolishness. Nothing but an outward and visible career passed
in nursing the sick in hospitals can, to this day, redeem it.</p>

<p>‘The public,’ says a sociologist,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_280" id="fnanchor_280"></a><a href="#footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></span> with charming scorn,
‘are acquainted with the nature of their own passions, and the
point of their own calamities; can laugh at the weakness they
feel, and weep at the miseries they have experienced: but all
the sagacity they possess, be it how great soever, will not
enable them to judge of likeness to that which they have never
seen, nor to acknowledge principles on which they have never
reflected. Of a comedy or a drama, an epigram or a ballad,
they are judges from whom there is no appeal; but not of
the representation of facts which they have never examined,
of beauty which they have never loved.’ The good public
and anything which savours of the merely supernatural, the
good public and the Kingdom of Heaven, in short, are incongruous.
But it is only fair to them to quote, again, the word
of a far more practical observer, which had, from the first, a
bearing on those whom the writer calls ‘the firebrands of the
Movement’: ‘I do not say the English are a people of good
<!--249.png--><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pageno">213</span>
sense, but I say they abhor extremes, and always fly off from
those who carry things too far.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_281" id="fnanchor_281"></a><a href="#footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></span> They do indeed. But every
conclusion becomes an extreme, and a thing carried too far,
where they are concerned.</p>

<p>Froude had always trimmed his sails not so much to the
wind, as according to a theory of navigation. It follows that
‘the picture of a mind,’ his mind, such as his friends wished to
exhibit it, was not a ‘necessity to the times’: in fact, it was
an intrusion upon them. It was in deadly hostility not only
to their low ideals, but to their ordinary characteristics and
best accepted spirit. Froude, or his unconscious influence,
was only too well organised to ‘toss and gore several persons,’
and the self-satisfied Establishment which had honourably
reared them. An illustration of existing contraries may not
be far to seek. Two good men of mark, born and dying in
the roomy Church of England, once expressed, each in his turn,
his feeling about his epitaph. Mr. Robert Southey was pleased
to say (with what his age considered perfect decorum, with
what our age must admit to be perfect truth): ‘I have this
conviction: that die when I may, my memory is one of those
which will “smell sweet, and blossom in the dust.”’ He also
repeated the sentiment in verse. But the testamentary ideas
of Richard William Church ran in another mould:</p>

<div class="poem-container no-break">
 <div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="i0a">‘<i>Rex tremendæ majestatis,</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i>Qui salvandos salvas gratis,</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i>Salva me, Fons Pietatis!</i>’</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>It is safe to predicate that thinking persons who sympathise
with the one, revolt from the other. Now the cleavage between
the dispositions which brought about these irreconcilable
expressions, is the cleavage in the national ideals. What is
so sure of blossoming in the dust, although professedly it lay
all stress upon the Vicarious Atonement, is Protestantism.
The belief in the necessity of the co-operative human will in
the scheme of Redemption, although it attain only to an
awestruck hope of the Almighty Mercy, is, well&mdash;not precisely
Protestantism! Between the two moods there is no mutual
approach, still less, amalgamation: for between them is set
<!--250.png--><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pageno">214</span>
up the Sign to be contradicted. It is to be feared that
Hurrell Froude, had he known of an admired poet’s intention
for ever to ‘smell sweet,’ could hardly have been restrained
from quoting his kinsman Hamlet’s ‘Pah!’ Piety which of
malice prepense smells sweet, will like Hurrell Froude no
better now than it liked him in the Tractarian twilight. It
will be seen that Mr. Southey was not enthusiastic over the
<cite>Remains</cite>.</p>

<p>To put the <cite>Remains</cite> on the open market was too bold a
venture of faith, though they would have served their dialectic
purpose well, and found their own readily, even had they been
privately issued, even if edited with greater reserve. It was
quite natural that Froude should have passed posthumously
for a mere agitator given up to triviality and impudence. If it
were true that for him living, ‘one constantly trembled, in
mixed society,’ what can have possessed his Editors to think
that his anarchist voice (the voice, really, of a great constructive
critic) would be suffered in a four-volume monologue? All
he was, all he thought, separated him by whole elements and
universes from the ordinary citizen. Accost between them
turned farcical in the act: ‘as if a dog should try to make friends
with a fish!’ His disqualifications for the final mission given
him were intellectual as well as moral. To name but two
among them, he was in love with the ‘Dark’ Ages, the fountainhead
of hard logic and thorough craftsmanship, and still more
in love with the original document, at a period when historical
research was not only unfashionable, but inferentially abhorred;
and his animus must needs have seemed ‘Popish’ or worse,
when it but led him to handle as self-evident fallacies the
darling predilections of centuries of British basilolatry.</p>

<p>It would have been bad enough had his convictions been
expressed always in academic terms, such as he himself,
after all, did employ pretty constantly in addressing the
magazine public. But Hurrell’s ‘little language,’ superadded
to his strong opinions, was too much for a day of buckramed
dignity. His verbal polity spared neither himself nor the
species, and it must have been appalling to others beside the
Holy Willies. Moreover, there was such gusto and emphasis
in all he said, that the effect was almost that, as it were, of
<!--251.png--><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pageno">215</span>
calling a spade a spade, with a plebeian ‘swear-word’ before it.
Nobody else in that English generation, not even Welby
Pugin, dealt in so elastic a vernacular. But surely, private
letters may take what tone and pace they please? Why did
it not occur to everyone to allow, in extenuation of this too
lively fashion of ‘sparks running to and fro among the reeds,’
that the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Froude was young, and younger, moreover,
than his years? The ideas of personal chronology then current
were illiberal. We know that men and women aged thirty
were looked upon as fairly venerable figures in the world of
our grandfathers, and were bound to have shed the last of the
pin-feathers of indiscretion. For purposes of general protest
against the common vanities of plumage, primitive attire
may with profit be retained: but it is likely to enrage the
barnyard. There is a good deal to be said for the speech
which suggests to us not Court dress, not even dressing-gown
and slippers, but overalls. It puts everything at once on a
workmanlike basis. A masterly critic has observed how
great a debt Newman owed to Hurrell Froude in the development
of his peerless ease and naturalness. To go further,
it may truly be said that one caught up the living accent of
the other. As a good latter instance, take Newman’s famous
passage in the <cite>Apologia</cite> about ‘seeing a ghost’ when the
point raised in an article on the Donatists first arrested him
in 1839. The echo is yet clearer in a contemporary letter.
‘It gave me the stomach-ache,’ he says. Such sportive
phraseology sounds the majestic capacity of educated human
expression. But sportive phraseology had its disadvantages,
when it was sent forth broadcast to ‘dictate to the clergy of
this country,’ or contribute towards ‘the picture of a mind’
known by the picturers to be chastened and grave. The
innumerable chapters of the <cite>Remains</cite> which were sober as a
monochrome were quite overborne, in popular estimation, even
where that estimation inclined to friendliness, by some few
prancing words or lines. The amice and cope of the stately
Muse of Theology symbolised nothing to the carpers who
believed that they had once caught a handmaid of hers in the
neat no-drapery of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps de ballet</i>. Indisposed to look
below the surface of Froude’s puzzling temperament, they found
<!--252.png--><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pageno">216</span>
only effrontery in his clear, terse, vivacious call, and only
dulness in his underlying mood, master of statement and definition,
and of armoured synthesis. It was not altogether their
fault: because his slang, it may as well be admitted, constitutes
a defect of character. It was a conscious revolt against
all that goes to make up ‘donnishness,’ and in so far an
element of strength as well as of comedy; but it was also the
makeshift of a man who contemned himself almost to the
point of eccentricity, and who often could not bear without a
mocking grimace, the serious utterance of his most serious
thought. Keble was full of fun, but Keble had no Hurrellisms,
no ‘little language.’ With the other, it is the note of a certain
spiritual unrest; an impiety against his own nature which all
sensitive human nature resents in some degree: the jest, indeed,
of a philosopher who never lost courage, but who never found
joy. Self-valuation and its calmly pompous accents are
understood, and even commended, all over the intellectual
world. But this bitter mood, as of a Cabinet Council plus the
Court fool, is too strange and new. There are those now, as
there were then, whom it shocks and deters.</p>

<p>Closely allied with all this is the question of his so
unceremonious dealing with men and things. As we are
reminded by his Editors, most of it was impersonal enough, for
his mind was set on principles only. ‘I allow hatred is an
imperfect state, but I think it is just young people that it
becomes’: is a remark from his remembered talk. ‘The
most difficult virtue to attain,’ he went on, ‘seems to me the
looking on wanton oppressors as mere machines, without feeling
any personal resentment.’ This is akin to a curious axiom of
Hazlitt’s, which would exonerate almost any cynic and sluggard,
that ‘to think ill of mankind, and not to wish them ill, is
perhaps the highest genius and virtue.’ Many adherents,
unblessed with imagination, of Froude’s own party, might be
brought to bay by his Common Room pronouncement that
‘the cultivation of right principles has a tendency to make
men dull and stupid.’ (His friend Thomas Mozley goes even
farther in the impious generalisation, and accuses Evangelical
goodness, ‘mixed with poverty and a certain amount of literary
or religious ambition,’ of producing ‘an unpleasant effect on
<!--253.png--><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pageno">217</span>
the skin!’) These endearments were, as was but just, not
confined by Froude to the elect. He was a hard hitter also
against individuals non-Jacobite and non-Apostolical; he
made ninepins of living and dead, great and small. On this
faculty, however, he was very far from priding himself. No
one could be more keenly aware of his sharp tongue than he.
Given events as he saw them, and his naked eye to transpierce
them, and his store of natural animation fostered in a home
atmosphere which was at all times highly charged with criticism,
and we have some explanation of his merciless proficiency in
adverbs and adjectives, applied impartially to the Bishop Jewels
of a past age, or the undergraduates of his own. From the
first, he had felt this smartness of speech to be his pitfall.
His journals are full of self-accusations, prayers, and resolutions
on the subject. ‘To-day, when &mdash;&mdash; called on me, I was
forced to watch myself at every turn, for fear of saying something
irreligious or uncharitable.’ … ‘I have again been
talking freely of people.’ … ‘Not to go out of my way to
say disrespectful things … not to say satirical things either
in people’s presence or behind their backs, or to take pleasure
in exposing them when they seem absurd, or to answer them
ill-naturedly when they have said offensive things.’ … ‘I said
I thought &mdash;&mdash; an ass, when there was not the least occasion
for me to express my sentiments about him. And yet I, so
severe on the follies, and so bitter against the slightest injuries
I get from others, am now presenting myself before my great
Father to ask for mercy on my most foul sins, and forgiveness
for my most incessant injuries. “How shall I be delivered
from the body of this death!”… I see nothing for it but not
to talk at all, and let myself be reckoned stupid and glumpy:
and this I will do. I must give up talking altogether except
where civility absolutely requires it. I am not to be trusted
with words.’</p>

<p>All this ‘mortal moral strife’ dates from his earliest manhood.
He certainly never relaxed the effort toward humbleness
and mental correction; though a superficial reader might
question whether he had, at the end, succeeded in attaining
any appreciable measure of either. But it is worth while
to remember here that his whole effort would be not to let
<!--254.png--><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pageno">218</span>
his friends at Oxford become aware of his victory, if he gained
it. Sooner than face human approval in these matters, he
would say, every day in the week, that he ‘thought &mdash;&mdash; an
ass,’ if only to keep up appearances.</p>

<p>Again, and apart from the amenities, the <cite>Remains</cite> are not
edited in a way to conciliate the unwilling. In one department,
they are provokingly presented with raggedly-pieced
phrases, names suppressed, and divers eliminations, almost
enough to kill interest; in another, they commit to the
general scrutiny amorphous themes, repetitions, the mere
crude bones of theory, fragments never shaped for the press.
Never was it truer, of any book or of any man, that</p>

<p class="unindent">The just apprehension of such an one is never discoverable
from what he may write. To be told that here was an Oxford
Fellow of genius and culture, and to be shown, in proof of it,
no professional arts whatever, but a stripped argument, and
‘the rigour of the game,’ flying personalities, tonic commonplaces,
buried first principles,&mdash;this was somewhat disconcerting.
Those who knew Hurrell Froude would take pride in
the Spartan simplicity of his every page, where sincere words
are welded with sincere thought. Those who knew him not
might turn away from that as from downright incapacity.</p>

<p>Of Keats, in his marvellous development, Mr. Lowell beautifully
says: ‘He knew that what he had to do had to be done
quickly.’ So, in a contrasted fashion, with Hurrell Froude,
intent not upon his own artistic perfection, but upon the
leavening of the national mind. Graces were just what he
could best afford to neglect in that too hurried working-hour.
He had begun to die at eight-and-twenty, and he was to
die unconsummated; therefore speech compacted and anticipative
became his sole concern. He is not light reading.
His typical sentences, apart from his many paradoxes, move
like the Latin axioms which break the heads of unwilling
schoolboys in walnut-time. A skeleton style, it must
be confessed, has its disqualifications as a miscellaneous
entertainer. Anything more unlike the golden, glowing,
<!--255.png--><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pageno">219</span>
misleading glide of the language of another Froude with whom
this generation is more familiar, can hardly be imagined.
Yet it was Hurrell who was the poet. It was Hurrell who,
according to all evidence, communicated in even higher degree
the extraordinary fascinations of that fascinating family.
It is not the least lovely of his attributes that he sacrificed
the literary possibilities of a born historian, as he sacrificed
everything else, to his holy master-passion, and carried his
genius for reigning into a hidden door-keeping of the House
of God.</p>

<p>The novelty and unexpectedness inseparable from his
original mind appear in print only as by innuendo, and in
the conduct of some coherent train of thought. Slyly quiet
can be the manner in which he understates, and negatively
proceeds through harmless analogies, until, of a sudden,
readers find with surprise, and cannot shake off, that ‘sting
in their bosoms’ which is referred to in a piercingly apposite
phrase, itself of classic origin, of the second Preface (1839) of
the <cite>Remains</cite>. All his papers, at least, of whatever nature,
display his faculty, which was like a scout’s or frontiersman’s,
of discovering, breaking, and defending border ground. They
are remarkable chiefly for their practical far-seeing sagacity.
Written over seventy years ago by a mere unconscious young
prophet with no conceit of himself, they have an amazing
modernity. The keen prescience of the few random secular
essays is, however, intensified in the other essays on religious
subjects. They ‘look before and after.’ They have not
begun to seem out-of-date, nor to label their author as fit only
for the never-dusted top shelf. In a day when views of
Inspiration and Revelation are no longer Butler’s or Paley’s;
when new keys are tried, and new tools taken up, and in the
ancient workshops men live and die to a different and far
more perplexing spheric music, such staying power, independent
of any encouragement of it, is sufficiently remarkable.
It gives Hurrell Froude an illustrative importance.
His very catchwords have a diverting contemporaneousness;
witness his uses of ‘Protestant’ as applied by him to the
unloved majority in his Church. The stuff of his intellectual
daily life is never altogether the timid, domestic, and amateurish
<!--256.png--><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><span class="pageno">220</span>
thing which Anglicanism must be, even at its best. In Froude
himself there is nothing very cognate to the long development
of European Christian thought; but at least he is no slave
of conventions, and from that tendency towards shrinkage and
encrustation which makes ‘every Englishman an island’ he is
always shaking himself free, by a half-unconscious gesture.
It is this good chronic revolt, this heroic reaching-forth, which
lends to him, in his incompleteness, a sporadic air of greatness.
In the spirit, as in the flesh, he was the traveller of the party.
His written pages are not, like Newman’s, literature for ever.
Their worth is that they show, with loyal plainness, not only
Froude’s dedicated interests, but the weight and depth of his
selfless intelligence; his bold adventurings and outridings;
his habit of looking unflattering deductions in the face; his
preoccupation with framework and foundation, and with them
exclusively; his instinct for the essential, for major issues, for
one or two premises which matter most, on subjects of faith,
and for the events of real significance in the history of
England which bear upon the Church. This instinct, in him,
was spontaneous and uncompanioned. In the whole field of
dogma, he first, of the seeking Wise Men of that generation,
was drawn towards the ‘Eucharistic doctrine with its huge
wealth of meaning, its promises of light, its complicated
connection with the body of revealed truth, to a great extent
unexplored, a mine of treasures hardly touched’;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_282" id="fnanchor_282"></a><a href="#footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></span> in the whole
field of ecclesiastical discipline, he alone fastened upon the
principle of freedom as the divine prerogative of the Church.
He inspired another to write of Hildebrand; he himself
wrote of the great Becket who was honoured, we know, by
Henry <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr></span> with a hatred highly intelligent and quaintly contemporary;
he notes more than once how Henry <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr></span>’s
tyrannising work, yet active, was in many respects the very
work attempted by Henry <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></span>, against whose ideals <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas
of Canterbury flung his influence and his life. On these
topics of incalculable importance, Froude laid his pausing
finger. He never occupied himself for one moment with
accidents and incidentals. Yet it has been said: ‘The Movement
<!--257.png--><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a><span class="pageno">221</span>
brought into action not a few who, like Mr. Richard
Hurrell Froude, could never advance beyond the impertinent
minutiæ and the ecclesiastical fopperies which became the
badges of their fraternity.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_283" id="fnanchor_283"></a><a href="#footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></span> It has been said. Let it pass
for ‘funny tormenting.’</p>

<p>Coleridge remarked, in summing up his old friend Charles
Lamb,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_284" id="fnanchor_284"></a><a href="#footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></span> that he had more totality and universality of character
than any man he had ever known. In some such terms must
be couched the eulogy of Hurrell Froude. He is all of a
piece. ‘From his very birth,’ as his mother put it, ‘his
temperament has been peculiar.’ He knew his mind, and
went his way. He, at least, did not</p>

<p class="center small">‘&mdash;half-live a hundred different lives.’</p>

<p class="unindent">He paid for such concentration of purpose with long oblivion.
Biography, a purblind creature, took him at his own valuation,
as we have seen, and gathered him not to her bosom. The
history of all the other Tractarians was written, the history
of the men who lived very long, long enough to see as
Cardinal Manning once said, the polarity of England changed,
when the one among them who died young was given his
chance. Until Dean Church, abetted by Lord Blachford,
made his worth plain, in the beautiful subduing art of a book
where all is charity and serene wisdom, Froude had inhabited
shadow-land, and was less than the phantom of his brother’s
brother. Eventually no mystic, but a wide-awake, matter-of-fact
person, he yet had always a sort of seal upon him of the
objective, the remote, the unearthly. Now that he has his
station and we have our perspective, these qualities increase
rather than diminish. The enfranchised vision of him now
is his inner self, more like a harper than a trumpeter. We
seem to see the thin tender face ‘shine’ out of night air, as
it shone at parting on his friend at Dartington, fifty-four years
before it smiled again at him out of the Light. Time is the
only crystal which gives us the souls of men and things.
<!--258.png--><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a><span class="pageno">222</span>
Whatever looks like idealisation there must be the literal
truth.</p>

<p>Hurrell Froude’s poet-friend Williams calls him</p>

<p class="center small">‘Like to himself alone, and no one else.’</p>

<p class="unindent">But he is unique without being isolated. His habitual mood
was a country of far distances, not unlike his own Devon,
where the rote is audible from a stern coast, and the
desolate tors stand up abrupt and sharp against the white
February horizon: a country which gets, in due season, its
own merriment of interlying verdure, and builds a most
delicate overhanging opal sky. There is in him, though
unexpressed, a wholeness and relativity as of this landscape.
His saliency and roguery, his affection, his wistful oddity,
his extraordinary intensity of life, the endearing charm which
has served to keep his memory bright as racing sea-fire,
only remind us the more how fully he belongs to the issues
to which he gave himself of old. The temptation to think
him a good deal like the sworded poets of the Civil Wars,
with their scarcely exerted aptitudes for the fine arts, whose
names leave a sort of star-dust along the pages of the
anthologies, need not blind us to his severer aspect: he is
also a good deal like the more militant among the Saints.
His first Editors thought so, and say so in that most fragrant
and touching Preface of theirs to his volumes printed in 1839.
He was wing and talon to them and to their holy hope.
‘Froude of the Movement’: he is that, first and last. Great
as is to the mere humanist eye his individual interest, he
cannot fairly be separated for a moment from the ideal to
which all that was in him belonged; to which he belongs in
its present and its yet unrevealed phases; to which he will
belong when, as the very vindication of his foregone career,
helping to breathe into successive generations the spirit of
cleansing scrutiny and renewing faith, Catholicism shall
triumph in England.</p>

<p>With that thought, we come suddenly out, as through a
black mountain-pass, into a quiet-coloured vista rolling between
us and the dawn. It is only too possible, in the beclouded
state of fallen man, to mistake some stage of a vast progress
<!--259.png--><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><span class="pageno">223</span>
for a disconnected trivial episode. But who are they so
unblest as to do it in this instance? Chiefly those enemies
who belong to the household. It was a convert squire of
Leicestershire, the friend of Montalembert, who in the boldness
of sanguine charity welcomed the very first <cite>Tracts</cite> as
nothing less than a pledge, given as it were in sleep, of ‘the
return of the Church [of England] to Catholic Unity and the
See of Peter’;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_285" id="fnanchor_285"></a><a href="#footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></span> and it was an Oxford Dean, long after, who
denied any orthodox future or any legitimate past to the
Ritualists of his day, refusing to connect them or their great
popularising leaven with the theoretic fathers that begat them.
There is little morality in this preference for reducing everything
to scraps and segments. Those who dare search for processes
rather than for dead issues may at least be respected. To
them, in an hour of all Latin degeneracy, the old sap of the
strongest of the northern races laughs in a stock long barren
but sound. Great outlooks call for great patience, lest they
strain the sight; and so with a spiritual event, believed-in, and
hardly descried. The lens of controversy will never bring it
nearer; only constant prayer, like an eye purged and made new,
can peer forward, and rest on the horizon-brink. If Catholicism
indeed triumph in England, Hurrell Froude’s cannot
ultimately remain a hidden and homeless name. Is it not
undeniable that he is to his own communion to-day, exactly
what he was long ago, a Hard Saying? Who have fought
shy of him, who have even belittled, hushed, buried him, if not
they? Has a single one of the vital questions which his restless
agitation opened, been settled by the exerted authority of the
corporate Church of England? In her immense miraculous
increase of ‘Catholic-mindedness,’ who has gone beyond this
wild, pathetic, precursive child in groping towards the fulness of
Revealed Truth, yet groping in the dark? He loved reality,
and entity: they were there next his hand, and he felt them
not. He seems never to have surmised the existence beside
<!--260.png--><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pageno">224</span>
him of the down-trodden <cite>Ecclesia Anglicana</cite> of Continental
sympathy, which in his brief day timidly lifted up her long-shrouded
penal head. But she, on her part, saw him reconstruct,
as in a worshipping dream, her every lineament. It
was a remark of Mr. Bernard Smith’s<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_286" id="fnanchor_286"></a><a href="#footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></span> which impressed Dr.
Wiseman, that ‘my friends at Oxford all think and speak of
Catholic practices and institutions as past or possible, not as
things actually existing and acting.’ That remark would not
need to be made now, when a people who owe nothing to their
Tudor organisers have won back by the power of what Sir
Thomas Browne calls ‘reminiscential evocation,’ so much of
the spirit of the religion which is their heritage. But when it
was made, the remark was curiously accurate. Even Froude,
in his <cite>Becket</cite>, cites the never-suspended usage of religious
houses in having books read aloud in the refectory, as an
English custom of ‘those times.’ As in trifles, so in graver
matters: Froude, and the contemporaries never quite abreast
of him, knew nothing of the continuity of family habit in the
historic Church. Newman tells us that while he was in Italy,
(and it can hardly have been otherwise with his friend,) he did
not guess at the significance of the burning sanctuary lamps
in Churches. ‘Radiantly sure of his position,’ as Canon Scott
Holland says, Froude was indeed; he had no personal misgivings;
his good faith was intact. Yet even he feared for his
‘Branch’;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_287" id="fnanchor_287"></a><a href="#footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></span> and he laid stress upon something in himself higher
than loyalty. If certain reforms did not follow, he would set
up for a ‘separatist.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_288" id="fnanchor_288"></a><a href="#footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></span> He did not live long enough to make
his choice; but those reforms have not followed. It stands for
little that some of his nearest relatives, and especially the one
friend whom he had most breathed upon, were constrained to
go the ‘separatist’ way; it stands for something more that to a
group of able observers of various creeds, he himself has seemed
a moving aurora, and not a fixed star of the Anglican heaven.
The speculation whether or no Froude would have been ‘out
<!--261.png--><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pageno">225</span>
in the ‘45’ has no lasting pertinence; but it has its illicit
unavoidable interest. No one who studies him tries to blink
it. Some among the distinguished High Churchmen who
have written of him are practically unanimous in the conviction
that longer lease of life would have made no difference in
his views, or that in any case he would have dwelt always in
the tents where he died. But the majority, having broached
the contrary opinion, encourage it, and lean towards it: of
this company are the Nonconformists, the Deists, the Catholics.
Dr. Rigg, a profound student of ethics, goes so far as to say
‘there can be no doubt’ that Hurrell Froude would have
changed his creed; Dr. Abbott’s strong arraignment implies
nothing less; many reviewers of Dean Church’s history propound
the question and assent to it; and Mr. James Anthony
Froude saw fit to play with it. The men of the ‘extreme Left,’
in this convocation, speak after a non-committal fashion, yet
there is no mistaking their longing, partly unexpressed:
M. Thureau-Dangin, Cardinal Wiseman, and the rest of their
following, seem to be ever thinking what only Canon Oakeley
quotes: <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum talis sis, utinam noster esses!</cite> They might
make, with perfect justice, the indisputable claim that the
<cite>Remains</cite> exerted the deeper influence over those very men
whose consciences drove them at last to leave the Church
as by Law Established in these Realms: the book bore a confessedly
vital part in the formation of William Lockhart, of
James Robert Hope-Scott, of Frederick William Faber, of
William George Ward. It is curious that the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Thomas
Mozley should father the statement, that the <cite>Remains</cite> ‘never
brought any one to Rome.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_289" id="fnanchor_289"></a><a href="#footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></span> But he may have had only
direct or primary causation in mind. That prickly book,
moreover, active as Hurrell himself, may be said, without
exaggeration, to have reacted on Newman’s ‘young men’ at
Oxford, who first disturbed, and then outstripped, their master.
It was the very crux of the complaint against them that, as
Newman himself was to say so accurately of Froude, they
were ‘powerfully drawn to the Mediæval, not to the Primitive
Church.’ We know how the cross-currents, coming from
Ward, Oakeley, Dalgairns, and the other extremists, cut
<!--262.png--><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pageno">226</span>
across the path of Newman turned anchorite, like a spring
freshet from unimagined hills. The ‘new party’ spoken of in
Stephens’ <cite>Life</cite> of Dean Hook,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_290" id="fnanchor_290"></a><a href="#footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></span> as being ‘as different in its
teachings from the original Tractarians as they had been from
the Evangelicals,’ were men almost all of whom entered the
Catholic Church of the Roman Obedience. They were filled
with the idea of the ever-living Interpretative Voice, as against
the mere bookish appeal to Christian antiquity. They were
strong in zeal, will, and prayer, and self-sacrificing; they were
also rash, notional, irrepressibly gay. Newman, whom they so
worried, did not suspect their descent; no critic seems to have
suspected it since: but were they not the true and immediate
seed of Hurrell Froude? If they were not, then, in the
language of the heralds, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">obiit sine prole</i>. How difficult it were
to accept that as part of the epitaph of so generative a spirit!
No school of thought in any communion, since 1836, has reproduced
so markedly the singular physiognomy of the author
of the <cite>Remains</cite>. To them alone he was not in the least
‘dangerous.’ But it is clear that in what has been called the
Church of Lord Halifax, there are a thousand young Froudians,
a collateral kindred with plenty of trouble before them, flying
his crest.</p>

<p>If we know aught about the trend of human character, we
know that there was a highly integrant strain in Hurrell Froude;
his whole short life was a thirst after the coherence and continuousness
of the things of faith. If we know aught about
the laws of moral motion, we know that he could neither have
gone round in a circle, nor stood still. Like the paradoxical
Briton he was, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il savait conclure</i>. It is far truer, potentially, of
him, than of Newman. Says Père Ragey, after the neat and
merciless manner of Frenchmen: ‘<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pour pousser ses idées
jusqu’à leurs dernières conséquences, Newman, n’avait eu qu’à
suivre la nature même de son esprit. Il était un de ces esprits
(assez rares parmi nos voisins d’outre Manche) qui se laissent conduire
par la logique, qui vont jusqu’au bout de leurs idées, et qui
savent conclure. La vie et les écrits de Pusey, au contraire,
nous montrent en lui un de ces esprits anglais si bien décrits</cite>
<!--263.png--><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><span class="pageno">227</span>
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par Taine, qui “restent en chemin et ne concluent pas.” …
De plus, il sentait bien qu’il n’était pas seul. Il avait avec
lui plus que des corréligionnaires, plus que des collaborateurs,
plus que les disciples: il avait avec lui et pour lui l’esprit
anglais. Les anglais, tout en admirant beaucoup Newman, et
en le plaçant au-dessus de Pusey, reconnaissent mieux leur
esprit dans Pusey que dans Newman.</cite>’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_291" id="fnanchor_291"></a><a href="#footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing can be safer for all of us conjointly than
to answer ‘No’ at once to that pithless query: Would
Froude have followed Newman? Froude would never have
<em>followed</em> Newman. Nor would the latter have paced up and
down for long lonely years in Oriel Lane, and in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Limbus
Innocentium</i> at Littlemore, nor invented <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oret pro nobis</i> for an
anodyne, had Froude been alive. It is the summing-up of a
thoughtful review that ‘most readers of the <cite>Apologia</cite> are
under the impression that [Newman] had started on the road
to Rome as soon as Froude’s influence succeeded to Whately’s;
and that if he were not unfaithful, he had to go on to the end….
Certainly, it does seem as if, after he had lost Froude,
Newman was very liable to be perplexed by opposition, to
watch for omens, to be at the mercy of accidents.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_292" id="fnanchor_292"></a><a href="#footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></span> Nothing
gives one such an idea of the immense propelling force which
Hurrell Froude was, as the untoward indecision into which
Newman soon fell, though he still had Pusey’s fortress-like
strength at his side. Even Keble, without the beloved ‘poker,’
burned with a somewhat darker flame. His silent beneficent
career at Hursley was a different matter from his career as
Oriel captain of artillery; and no careful student can fail to
notice that his later spiritual direction tended more and more
towards the nebulous. As for Hurrell, he was bound to be
astir, living or dead, in one direction or another. Without
being prepared to look frankly upon October 9, 1845, as
his true field-day, open-minded persons may harbour a
sympathetic wonder whether in the English event which
crowns it he were quite unimplicated? ‘Was it Gregory or
was it Basil, that blew the trumpet in Constantinople?’
When Newman sadly transferred himself to Oscott, in the
<!--264.png--><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><span class="pageno">228</span>
February of 1846, he would have remembered, after his
remembering habit, how strangely, yet naturally, in the
Providence of God, he was keeping the tenth anniversary of
the loss of his dearest friend, no part of whose office could be
filled even by an Ambrose <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John, ‘whom God gave me when
He took all else away.’</p>

<p>‘Hurrell Froude lives,’ says Principal Fairbairn epigrammatically,
‘in Newman.’ It would be an interesting task for
a biographer to examine and define the measure of response
with which ‘the Vicar,’ in his historic seclusion, worked into
one scheme his ideas, and the ideas bequeathed to him by the
least ‘flinching’ Anglican in the world. Froude had managed
to give Newman, (and with no more ceremonial pomp than
one infant employs in tossing sea-shells to another,) the norm
of every single one of his great theories. This short span
beside that old age, this quick, forward-reaching, never-ripened
thought beside the ‘long gestation’ of the sublime
soul whom we know better, may not unfitly be compared to a
keynote struck in a grace-note before the full major chord.
The chord owes nothing of its position, or its compotent
harmony, to the mere sweet hint which announces it and is
instantaneously whelmed in it, but it certainly does owe to it
almost all of what may be called its idiomatic beauty. To no
educated ear is the chord with that apposition, and the chord
without it, conceivably the same.</p>

<p>It is his glory that Froude cannot be severed, early or
late, from the superior genius once so ‘fain to be his heir.’
As he stands fast with what Mr. Wilfrid Ward has named
‘that great crisis of spiritual animation, unparalleled in our
age and country,’ which has transformed the Church of
England, and with his Achates, as that Achates was up to
1845, so he walks on with the white-haired Cardinal of all
men’s honour, through whom a torrent of new life streamed,
and streams, into the English-speaking children of the
Apostolic See, but who</p>

<p class="center small">‘&mdash;came to Oxford and his friends no more.’</p>

Never was it better justified than in his lifelong sense of obligation
to the clear brain and pure devout heart of a young man
of no celebrity, whose full significance is not past, but to come.</p>

<p>To a Catholic, Froude has something yet finer than his
‘totality and universality of character.’ He has the grace
of God. He stands in a mysterious place,</p>

 Milton, as early as 1817, was one of Keble’s own big bold prejudices. It is but
fair to Froude to quote, in order that his remark may not be misconstrued, his conviction
that ‘it is not perhaps too much to say that [Milton’s] was the most powerful
mind which ever applied itself to poetry.’ Like Professor Raleigh in our own day,
Froude denied that colossal genius to be, properly speaking, a religious poet at all.

 Hurrell seems to have known and liked his senior, Edward Hawkins (1798-1884,
Fellow of Oriel, 1813, Provost, succeeding Copleston, 1828), at this time. But ‘not
the least of a Don’ is emphatically not descriptive of him, but of Richard Whately,
1787-1863, afterwards Archbishop of Dublin. ‘No Don was ever less donnish …
he revelled in setting conventions at naught,’ etc. Dr. Rigg, in the <cite>Dictionary of

Sodbury, Gloucester, and Prebendary of Worcester Cathedral. He had a very high
repute at Oxford, and, like Whately, was mentioned ‘with bated breath.’</p>

 Probably Hurrell’s old friend, Robert Isaac Wilberforce, then, like himself, a
newly-made Fellow of Oriel. (‘Old’ was Hurrell’s most endearing adjective: he
applies it unexpectedly in one letter: ‘old Becket.’) Robert Wilberforce’s temperament
was far more studious and calm than that of his genial younger brothers, but
apparently he could be ‘funny’ and ‘good-natured’ too. ‘R. Wilberforce was as
merry as he generally is,’ writes his hostess, Mrs. Rickards, from Ulcombe, to Miss
Jemima Newman, in the autumn of 1827.</p>

 ‘On The Hateful Party: probably the Liberal Party of 1833.’ <cite>Lyra Apostolica</cite>,
Beeching’s edition, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 140. But possibly the reference is to the English Reformers,
and the poet’s idea that they should be considered serviceable, in a way, to the very
spirit of Catholicism which they did their best to destroy. However, the context of
Froude’s letter to Keble, going on to mention, as it does, a current political interest
as inspiration (not forthcoming) for the next copy of verses, tends to bear out
Mr. Beeching’s theory. <cite>Lyra Apostolica</cite> began as a separate poetic section of <cite>The

good to our enemies, as if ‘to heap coals of fire on their heads,’ and to take the

that they did not light upon Coleridge’s passage at first-hand, but that somebody
brought it to their attention: they, on their part, had accomplished, by chance, the
extraordinary feat of ignoring Coleridge. ‘In extreme old age Newman wrote to
a friend: “I never read a word of Kant. I never read a word of Coleridge….

 Hurrell may well have known the state of poor Williams’ heart in regard to Miss
Caroline Champernowne of Dartington Hall: the marriage, however, did not come
off until 1842. Mr. Keble is not mentioned in his worshipping disciple’s incriminating

<p class="footnote unindent">was made after Keble’s death, by his executors, and in accordance with his own
request. The request was based upon that of ‘my dear friend Hurrell Froude,’
over thirty years before. Keble had long held out against the alteration, and for
what he thought good cause, even against Pusey, maintaining that ‘Not in the hands’
should be understood as ‘Not [only] in the hands.’ He had precedents and analogies
to lean upon. But when Bishop Jeune on February 9, 1866, quoted the original
lines in Convocation as against the Real Objective Presence, the poet, then near his
end, eagerly effected the change. The ordinary reader may wonder whether a more
astounding variant be known to doctrinal statement.</p>

 Renn Dickson Hampden, <abbr title="Doctor of Divinity">D.D.</abbr>, 1793-1868, received in October, 1836, his
famous (Dean Burgon’s adjective was ‘scandalous’) appointment by Lord Melbourne
to the Regius Professorship of Divinity in the University of Oxford, against the vehement
and prolonged opposition of both Low Church and High Church, to whom
‘Hampdenism’ meant nothing less than the negation of Christian doctrine and the
Catholic spirit. Hampden, if not ‘Hampdenism,’ was to be greatly crippled by the
Oxford Convocation of the following May.</p>

 The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> R. C. Fillingham’s wit, wasted on a winter Sunday morning in the
Pembroke Street Chapel, Oxford, may be worth hoarding up. ‘The Martyrs died to
protest against the ridiculous doctrine of the Real Presence, and the man who preached
that doctrine from the pulpit was a traitor, and deserved to be drummed out of the
Church. (Applause)…. The new religion of the Church of England was founded
in 1833 … in order to save the endowments, and was really a pecuniary dodge.
The Martyrs’ Memorial protested against it, and said this new thing was not the
religion of the true Church of England. The Memorial protested against dishonesty;
it stood as a protest against shams, etc., etc.’&mdash;<cite>The Oxford Times, <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 16, 1904.</cite></p>

 The physical resemblance between R. H. F.’s child-portrait and <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">il buon Pippo</i>,
becomes none the less noteworthy when one turns towards what Newman wrote from
Rome to his sister about <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Philip Neri, on January 26, 1847. ‘This great Saint
reminds me in so many ways of Keble, that I can fancy what Keble would have
been … in another place and age; he was formed on the same type of extreme
hatred of humbug, playfulness, nay, oddity, tender love of others, and severity.’

RELATION TO THE OXFORD MOVEMENT</p>

<p class="hanging">From ‘<span class="smcap">The Oxford Movement: Twelve Years</span>, 1833-1845,’
By <span class="smcap">R. W. Church</span>, <abbr title="Master of Arts">M.A.</abbr>, <abbr title="Doctor of Civil Law">D.C.L.</abbr>, sometime
Dean of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul’s, and Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford.
London: Macmillan &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, 1891.</p>

<p class="center small">[By the kind permission of Miss Church and of Messrs. Macmillan &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>]</p>

<p class="p2">‘What was it that turned [Keble] by degrees into so prominent
and so influential a person? It was the result of the
action of his convictions and ideas, and still more of his
character, on the energetic and fearless mind of a pupil and
disciple, Richard Hurrell Froude. Froude was Keble’s pupil
at Oriel, and when Keble left Oriel for his curacy at the beginning
of the Long Vacation of 1823, he took Froude with him
to read for his degree. He took with him ultimately two
other pupils, Robert Wilberforce and Isaac Williams of Trinity.
One of them, Isaac Williams, has left some reminiscences of
the time, and of the terms on which the young men were with
their tutor, then one of the most famous men at Oxford. They
were terms of the utmost freedom. “Master is the greatest
boy of them all,” was the judgment of the rustic who was
gardener, groom, and parish clerk to Mr. Keble. Froude’s
was a keen logical mind, not easily satisfied, contemptuous of
compromises and evasions, and disposed on occasion to be
mischievous and aggressive; and with Keble, as with anybody
else, he was ready to dispute and try every form of dialectical
<!--272.png--><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pageno">236</span>
experiment. But he was open to higher influences than those
of logic, and in Keble he saw what subdued and won him to
boundless veneration and affection. Keble won the love of the
whole little society; but in Froude he had gained a disciple
who was to be the mouthpiece and champion of his ideas,
and who was to react on himself and carry him forward to
larger enterprises and bolder resolutions than by himself he
would have thought of. Froude took in from Keble all he
had to communicate: principles, convictions, moral rules and
standards of life, hopes, fears, antipathies. And his keenly-tempered
intellect, and his determination and high courage,
gave a point and an impulse of their own to Keble’s views and
purposes. As things came to look darker, and dangers seemed
more serious to the Church, its faith or its rights, the interchange
of thought between master and disciple, in talk and in
letter, pointed more and more to the coming necessity of
action; and Froude at least had no objections to the business
of an agitator. But all this was very gradual; things did not
yet go beyond discussion; ideas, views, arguments were examined
and compared; and Froude, with all his dash, felt
as Keble felt, that he had much to learn about himself,
as well as about books and things. In his respect for antiquity,
in his dislike of the novelties which were invading
Church rules and sentiments, as well as its Creeds, in his
jealousy of the State, as well as in his seriousness of self-discipline,
he accepted Keble’s guidance and influence more
and more; and from Keble he had more than one lesson
of self-distrust, more than one warning against the temptations
of intellect. “Froude told me many years after,”
writes one of his friends, “that Keble once, before parting
with him, seemed to have something on his mind which he
wished to say, but shrank from saying, while waiting, I think,
for a coach. At last he said, just before parting, ‘Froude,
you thought Law’s <cite>Serious Call</cite> was a clever book; it seemed
to me as if you had said the Day of Judgement will be a
pretty sight.’ This speech, Froude told me, had a great effect
on his after life.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_294" id="fnanchor_294"></a><a href="#footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></span></p>

came back to Oxford, charged with Keble’s thoughts and
feelings, and from his more eager and impatient temper, more
on the look-out for ways of giving them effect. The next
year he became Tutor, and he held the tutorship till 1830.
But he found at Oriel a colleague, a little his senior in age and
standing, of whom Froude and his friends as yet knew little
except that he was a man of great ability, that he had been a
favourite of Whately’s, and that in a loose and rough way he
was counted among the few Liberals and Evangelicals in Oxford.
This was Mr. Newman. Keble had been shy of him,
and Froude would at first judge him by Keble’s standard.
But Newman was just at this time “moving,” as he expresses
it, “out of the shadow of Liberalism.” Living not apart like
Keble, but in the same College, and meeting every day, Froude
and Newman could not but be either strongly and permanently
repelled, or strongly attracted. They were attracted: attracted
with a force which at last united them in the deepest and most
unreserved friendship. Of the steps of this great change in
the mind and fortunes of each of them we have no record:
intimacies of this kind grow in College out of unnoticed and
unremembered talks, agreeing or differing, out of unconscious
disclosures of temper and purpose, out of walks and rides and
quiet breakfasts and Common-Room arguments, out of admirations
and dislikes, out of letters and criticisms and questions;
and nobody can tell afterwards how they have come about.
The change was gradual and deliberate. Froude’s friends in
Gloucestershire, the Keble family, had their misgivings about
Newman’s supposed Liberalism; they did not much want to
have to do with him. His subtle and speculative temper did
not always square with Froude’s theology. “N. is a fellow
that I like more, the more I think of him,” Froude wrote in
1828; “only I would give a few odd pence if he were not a
heretic.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_295" id="fnanchor_295"></a><a href="#footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></span> But Froude, who saw him every day, and was soon
associated with him in the tutorship, found a spirit more akin
to his own in depth and freedom and daring, than he had yet
encountered. And Froude found Newman just in that maturing
state of religious opinion in which a powerful mind like Froude’s
would be likely to act decisively. Each acted on the other.
<!--274.png--><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a><span class="pageno">238</span>
Froude represented Keble’s ideas, Keble’s enthusiasm. Newman
gave shape, foundation, consistency, elevation to the
Anglican theology, when he accepted it, which Froude had
learned from Keble. “I knew him first,” we read in the
<cite>Apologia</cite>, “in 1826, and was in the closest and most
affectionate friendship with him from about 1829 till his
death in 1836.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_296" id="fnanchor_296"></a><a href="#footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></span> But this was not all. Through Froude,
Newman came to know and to be intimate with Keble;
and a sort of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">camaraderie</i> arose of very independent and
outspoken people, who acknowledged Keble as their master
and counsellor.</p>

<p>‘“The true and primary author of it” (the Tractarian Movement),
we read in the <cite>Apologia</cite>, “as is usual with great motive
powers, was out of sight…. Need I say that I am speaking
of John Keble?” The statement is strictly true. Froude
never would have been the man he was but for his daily and
hourly intercourse with Keble; and Froude brought to bear
upon Newman’s mind, at a critical period of its development,
Keble’s ideas and feelings about religion and the Church,
Keble’s reality of thought and purpose, Keble’s transparent
and saintly simplicity. And Froude, as we know from a well-known
saying of his,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_297" id="fnanchor_297"></a><a href="#footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></span> brought Keble and Newman to understand
one another, when the elder man was shy and suspicious
of the younger, and the younger, though full of veneration for
the elder, was hardly yet in full sympathy with what was most
characteristic and most cherished in the elder’s religious convictions.
Keble attracted and moulded Froude: he impressed
Froude with his strong Churchmanship, his severity and reality
of life, his poetry, and high standard of scholarly excellence.
Froude learned from him to be anti-Erastian, anti-Methodistical,
anti-sentimental, and as strong in his hatred
of the world, as contemptuous of popular approval, as any
Methodist. Yet all this might merely have made a strong
impression, or formed one more marked school of doctrine,
without the fierce energy which received it and which it
inspired. But Froude, in accepting Keble’s ideas, resolved to
make them active, public, aggressive; and he found in
Newman a colleague whose bold originality responded to his
<!--275.png--><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pageno">239</span>
own. Together they worked as Tutors; together they worked
when their tutorships came to an end; together they worked
when thrown into companionship in their Mediterranean
voyage, in the winter of 1832 and the spring of 1833. They
came back full of aspirations and anxieties which spurred
them on; their thoughts had broken out in papers sent home
from time to time to Rose’s <cite>British Magazine</cite> (“Home
Thoughts Abroad”) and the <cite>Lyra Apostolica</cite>. Then came
the meeting at Hadleigh, and the beginning of the Tracts.
Keble had given the inspiration, Froude had given the
impulse; then Newman took up the work, and the impulse
henceforward, and the direction, were his.</p>

<p>‘Doubtless, many thought and felt like them about the
perils which beset the Church and religion. Loyalty to the
Church, belief in her divine mission, allegiance to her authority,
readiness to do battle for her claims, were anything but
extinct in her ministers and laity. The elements were all
about of sound and devoted Churchmanship. Higher ideas of
the Church than the popular and political notion of it, higher
conceptions of Christian doctrine than those of the ordinary
Evangelical theology&mdash;echoes of the meditations of a remarkable
Irishman, Mr. Alexander Knox&mdash;had in many quarters
attracted attention in the works and sermons of his disciple,
Bishop Jebb, though it was not till the Movement had taken
shape that their full significance was realised. Others besides
Keble and Froude and Newman were seriously considering
what could best be done to arrest the current which was
running strong against the Church, and discussing schemes of
resistance and defence. Others were stirring up themselves
and their brethren to meet the new emergencies, to respond to
the new call. Some of these were in communication with the
Oriel men, and ultimately took part with them in organising
vigorous measures. But it was not till Mr. Newman made up
his mind to force on the public mind, in a way which could
not be evaded, the great article of the Creed, “I believe one
Catholic and Apostolic Church,” that the Movement began.
And for the first part of its course, it was concentrated at
Oxford. It was the direct result of the searchings of
heart and the communings for seven years, from 1826 to
<!--276.png--><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pageno">240</span>
1833, of the three men who have been the subject of this
chapter.</p>

<p>‘Hurrell Froude<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_298" id="fnanchor_298"></a><a href="#footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></span> soon passed away before the brunt of the
fighting came. His name is associated with Mr. Newman and
Mr. Keble, but it is little more than a name to those who now
talk of the origin of the Movement. Yet all who remember
him agree in assigning to him an importance as great as that
of any, in that little knot of men whose thoughts and whose
courage gave birth to it…. He was early cut off from direct
and personal action on the course which things took. But it
would be a great mistake to suppose that his influence on the
line taken, and on the minds of others, was inconsiderable. It
would be more true to say that, with one exception, no one
was more responsible for the impulse which led to the Movement;
no one had more to do with shaping its distinct aims
and its moral spirit and character, in its first stage; no one
was more daring and more clear, as far as he saw, in what he
was prepared for. There was no one to whom his friends so
much looked up with admiration and enthusiasm. There was
no “wasted shade”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_299" id="fnanchor_299"></a><a href="#footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></span> in Hurrell Froude’s disabled, prematurely
shortened life.</p>

<p><!--277.png--><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span class="pageno">241</span>
‘Like Henry Martyn, he was made by strong and even
merciless self-discipline over a strong and for a long time
refractory nature. He was a man of great gifts, with much
that was most attractive and noble; but joined with this there
was originally in his character a vein of perversity and mischief,
always in danger of breaking out, and with which he kept up
a long and painful struggle. His inmost thought and knowledge
of himself have been laid bare in the papers which his
friends published after his death. He was in the habit of
probing his motives to the bottom, and of recording without
mercy what he thought his self-deceits and affectations. The
religious world of the day made merry over his methods of
self-discipline; but whatever may be said of them, (and such
things are not easy to judge of), one thing is manifest, that
they were true and sincere efforts to conquer what he thought
evil in himself, to keep himself in order, to bring his inmost
self into subjection to the Law and Will of God. The self-chastening
which his private papers show, is no passion or
value for asceticism, but a purely moral effort after self-command
and honesty of character; and what makes the
struggle so touching is its perfect reality and truth. He
“turned his thoughts on that desolate wilderness, his own
conscience, and said what he saw there.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_300" id="fnanchor_300"></a><a href="#footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></span> A man who has had
a good deal to conquer in himself, and has gone a good way
to conquer it, is not apt to be indulgent to self-deceit or
indolence, or even weakness. The basis of Froude’s character
was a demand which would not be put off for what was real
and thorough; an implacable scorn and hatred for what he
counted shams and pretences. “His highest ambition,” he
used to say, “was to be a humdrum.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_301" id="fnanchor_301"></a><a href="#footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></span> The intellectual and
the moral parts of his character were of a piece. The tricks
and flimsinesses of a bad argument provoked him as much as
the imposture and “flash” of insincere sentiment and fine
talking; he might be conscious of “flash” in himself and his
friends, and he would admit it unequivocally; but it was as
unbearable to him to pretend not to see a fallacy as soon as it
was detected, as it would have been to him to arrive at the
right answer of a sum or a problem by tampering with the
<!--278.png--><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><span class="pageno">242</span>
processes. Such a man, with strong affections and keen
perception of all forms of beauty, and with the deepest desire
to be reverent towards all that had a right to reverence, would
find himself in the most irritating state of opposition and
impatience with much that passed as religion round him.
Principles not attempted to be understood and carried into
practice; smooth self-complacency among those who looked
down on a blind and unspiritual world; the continual provocation
of worthless reasoning and ignorant platitudes; the dull
unconscious stupidity of people who could not see that the
times were critical, that Truth had to be defended, and that it
was no easy or light-hearted business to defend it;&mdash;threw him
into an habitual attitude of defiance, and half-amused, half-earnest
contradiction, which made him feared by loose
reasoners and pretentious talkers, and even by quiet easy-going
friends, who unexpectedly found themselves led on blindfold,
with the utmost gravity, into traps and absurdities, by the
wiles of his mischievous dialectic. This was the outside look
of his relentless earnestness. People who did not like him or
his views, and who, perhaps, had winced under his irony,
naturally put down his strong language, which on occasion
could certainly be unceremonious, to flippancy and arrogance.
But within the circle of those whom he trusted, or of those
who needed at any time his help, another side disclosed itself:
a side of the most genuine warmth of affection; an awful
reality of devoutness, which it was his great and habitual effort
to keep hidden; a high simplicity of unworldliness and
generosity; and, in spite of his daring mockeries of what was
commonplace or showy, the most sincere and deeply felt
humility with himself. Dangerous as he was often thought to
be in conversation, one of the features of his character which
has impressed itself on the memory of one who knew him well,
was his “patient, winning considerateness in discussion, which,
with other qualities, endeared him to those to whom he opened
his heart.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_302" id="fnanchor_302"></a><a href="#footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></span> “It is impossible,” writes James Mozley in 1833,
with a mixture of amusement, speaking of the views about
celibacy which were beginning to be current, “to talk with
Froude without committing one’s self on such subjects as
<!--279.png--><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><span class="pageno">243</span>
these; so that by and by I expect the tergiversants will be a
considerable party.” His letters, with their affectionately playful
addresses, <ins title="daimonie, ainotate, pepon">δαιμόνιε, αἰνότατε, πέπον</ins>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carissime</i>, “<cite>Sir, my dear
friend</cite>,” or “<ins title="Argeiôn och’ ariste">Ἀργείων ὄχ’ ἄριστε</ins>, have you not been a spoon?”
are full of the most delightful ease and verve and sympathy.</p>

<p>‘With a keen sense of English faults he was, as Cardinal
Newman has said, “an Englishman to the backbone”; and he
was, further, a fastidious, high-tempered English gentleman, in
spite of his declaiming about “pampered aristocrats” and the
“gentleman heresy.” His friends thought of him as of the
“young Achilles,” with his high courage, and noble form, and
“eagle eye,” made for such great things, but appointed so soon
to die. “Who can refrain from tears at the thought of that
bright and beautiful Froude?” is the expression of one of them<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_303" id="fnanchor_303"></a><a href="#footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></span>
shortly before his death, and when it was quite certain that
the doom which had so long hung over him was at hand. He
had the love of doing for the mere sake of doing what was
difficult or even dangerous to do, which is the mainspring of
characteristic English sports and games. He loved the sea;
he liked to sail his own boat, and enjoyed rough weather, and
took interest in the niceties of seamanship and shipcraft. He
was a bold rider across country. With a powerful grasp on
mathematical truths and principles, he entered with wholehearted
zest into inviting problems, or into practical details of
mechanical or hydrostatic or astronomical science. His letters
are full of such observations, put in a way which he thought
would interest his friends, and marked by his strong habit of
getting into touch with what was real and of the substance of
questions. He applied his thoughts to architecture with a
power and originality which at the time were not common.
No one who only cared for this world could be more attracted
and interested than he was by the wonder and beauty of its
facts and appearances. With the deepest allegiance to his
home, and reverence for its ties and authority, (a home of the
old-fashioned ecclesiastical sort, sober, manly, religious, orderly,)
he carried into his wider life the feelings with which he had
been brought up; bold as he was, his reason and his character
craved for authority, but authority which morally and reasonably
<!--280.png--><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><span class="pageno">244</span>
he could respect. Mr. Keble’s goodness and purity
subdued him, and disposed him to accept, without reserve, his
master’s teaching: and towards Mr. Keble, along with an
outside show of playful criticism and privileged impertinence,
there was a reverence which governed Froude’s whole nature.
In the wild and rough heyday of reform, he was a Tory of the
Tories. But when authority failed him, from cowardice or
stupidity or self-interest, he could not easily pardon it; and he
was ready to startle his friends by proclaiming himself a
Radical, prepared for the sake of the highest and greatest
interests to sacrifice all second-rate and subordinate ones.</p>

<p>‘When his friends, after his death, published selections from
his journals and letters, the world was shocked by what
seemed his amazing audacity, both of thought and expression,
about a number of things and persons which it was customary
to regard as almost beyond the reach of criticism. The
<cite>Remains</cite> lent themselves admirably to the controversial process
of culling choice phrases and sentences and epithets surprisingly
at variance with conventional and popular estimates. Friends
were pained and disturbed; foes, naturally enough, could not
hold in their overflowing exultation at such a disclosure of the
spirit of the Movement. Sermons and newspapers drew
attention to Froude’s extravagances, with horror and disgust.
The truth is, that if the off-hand sayings in conversation or
letters of any man of force and wit and strong convictions
about the things and persons that he condemns, were made
known to the world, they would by themselves have much the
same look of flippancy, injustice, impertinence, to those who
disagreed in opinion with the speaker or writer; they are
allowed for, or they are not allowed for by others, according
to what is known of his general character. The friends who
published Froude’s <cite>Remains</cite> knew what he was; they knew
the place and proportion of the fierce and scornful passages;
they knew that they really did not go beyond the liberty and
the frank speaking which most people give themselves in the
<em>abandon</em> and understood exaggeration of intimate correspondence
and talk. But they miscalculated the effect on those
who did not know him, or whose interest it was to make the
most of the advantage given them. They seem to have
<!--281.png--><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a><span class="pageno">245</span>
expected that the picture which they presented of their friend’s
transparent sincerity and singleness of aim, manifested amid
so much pain and self-abasement, would have touched readers
more. They miscalculated in supposing that the proofs of so
much reality of religious earnestness would carry off the
offence of vehement language, which without these proofs
might naturally be thought to show mere random violence.
At any rate the result was much natural and genuine irritation,
which they were hardly prepared for. Whether on general
grounds they were wise in startling and vexing friends, and
putting fresh weapons into the hands of opponents by their
frank disclosure of so unconventional a character, is a question
which may have more than one answer: but one thing is
certain, they were not wise, if they only desired to forward the
immediate interests of their party or cause. It was not the
act of cunning conspirators: it was the act of men who were
ready to show their hands, and take the consequences.
Undoubtedly, they warned off many who had so far gone
along with the Movement, and who now drew back. But if
the publication was a mistake, it was the mistake of men
confident in their own straightforwardness.</p>

<p>‘There is a natural Nemesis to all over-strong and exaggerated
language. The weight of Froude’s judgments was
lessened by the disclosure of his strong words, and his dashing
fashion of condemnation and dislike gave a precedent for the
violence of shallower men. But to those who look back on
them now, though there can be no wonder that at the time
they excited such an outcry, their outspoken boldness hardly
excites surprise. Much of it might naturally be put down to
the force of first impressions; much of it is the vehemence of
an Englishman who claims the liberty of criticising and finding
fault at home; much of it was the inevitable vehemence of a
reformer. Much of it seems clear foresight of what has since
come to be recognised. His judgments on the Reformers,
startling as they were at the time, are not so very different,
as to the facts of the case, from what most people on all sides
now agree in; and as to their temper and theology, from what
most Churchmen would now agree in. Whatever allowances
may be made for the difficulties of their time, (and these allowances
<!--282.png--><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a><span class="pageno">246</span>
ought to be very great), and however well they may have
done parts of their work, such as the translations and adaptations
of the Prayer-Book, it is safe to say that the divines of
the Reformation never can be again, with their confessed
Calvinism, with their shifting opinions, their extravagant
deference to the foreign oracles of Geneva and Zurich, their
subservience to bad men in power, the heroes and saints of
Churchmen. But when all this is said, it still remains true
that Froude was often intemperate and unjust. In the hands
of the most self-restrained and considerate of its leaders, the
Movement must anyhow have provoked strong opposition, and
given great offence. The surprise and the general ignorance
were too great; the assault was too rude and unexpected.
But Froude’s strong language gave it a needless exasperation.</p>

<p>‘Froude was a man strong in abstract thought and imagination,
who wanted adequate knowledge. His canons of judgment
were not enlarged, corrected, and strengthened by any
reading or experience commensurate with his original powers
of reasoning or invention. He was quite conscious of it, and
did his best to fill up the gap in his intellectual equipment.
He showed what he might have done under more favouring
circumstances in a very interesting volume on Becket’s history
and letters. But circumstances were hopelessly against him: he
had not time, he had not health and strength, for the learning
which he so needed, which he so longed for. But wherever
he could, he learned. He was quite ready to submit his prepossessions
to the test and limitation of facts. Eager and
quick-sighted, he was often apt to be hasty in conclusions
from imperfect or insufficient premises; but even about what
he saw most clearly he was willing to hold himself in suspense,
when he found that there was something more to know.
Cardinal Newman has noted two deficiencies which, in his
opinion, were noticeable in Froude. “He had no turn for
theology as such”; and, further, he goes on: “I should say
that his power of entering into the minds of others was not
equal to his other gifts”: a remark which he illustrates by
saying that Froude could not believe that “I really held the
Roman Church to be anti-Christian.” The want of this power&mdash;in
which he stood in such sharp contrast to his friend&mdash;might
<!--283.png--><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><span class="pageno">247</span>
be either a strength or a weakness: a strength, if
his business was only to fight; a weakness, if it was to
attract and persuade. But Froude was made for conflict, not
to win disciples. Some wild solemn poetry, marked by deep
feeling and direct expression, is scattered through his letters,
kindled always by things and thoughts of the highest significance,
and breaking forth with force and fire. But probably
the judgment passed on him by a clever friend,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_304" id="fnanchor_304"></a><a href="#footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></span> from the
examination of his handwriting, was a true one: “This fellow
has a great deal of imagination, but not the imagination of a
poet.” He felt that even beyond poetry there are higher
things than anything that imagination can work upon. It
was a feeling which made him blind to the grandeur of Milton’s
poetry. He saw in it only an intrusion into the most sacred
of sanctities….</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘Froude’s first letter to Mr. Newman is in August, 1828.
It is the letter of a friendly and sympathising colleague in
College work, glad to be free from the “images of impudent
undergraduates”; he inserts some lines of verse, talks about
Dollond and telescopes, and relates how he and a friend got
up at half-past two in the morning, and walked half a mile to
see Mercury rise; he writes about his mathematical studies
and reading for Orders, and how a friend had “read half
through Prideaux and yet accuses himself of idleness”; but
there is no interchange of intimate thought. Mr. Newman
was at this time, as he has told us, drifting away from under
the shadow of Liberalism; and in Froude he found a man who,
without being a Liberal, was as quick-sighted, as courageous,
and as alive to great thoughts and new hopes as himself.
Very different in many ways, they were in this alike, that the
commonplace notions of religion and the Church were utterly
unsatisfactory to them, and that each had the capacity for
affectionate and whole-hearted friendship. The friendship
began and lasted on, growing stronger and deeper to the end.
And this was not all. Froude’s friendship with Mr. Newman
overcame Mr. Keble’s hesitations about Mr. Newman’s supposed
<!--284.png--><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a><span class="pageno">248</span>
Liberalism. Mr. Newman has put on record what he thought
and felt about Froude: no one, probably, of the many whom
Cardinal Newman’s long life has brought round him, ever
occupied Froude’s place in his heart.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_305" id="fnanchor_305"></a><a href="#footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></span> The correspondence
shows in part the way in which Froude’s spirit rose, under the
sense of having such a friend to work with, in the cause which,
day by day, grew greater and more sacred in the eyes of both.
Towards Mr. Keble Froude felt like a son to a father; towards
Mr. Newman like a soldier to his comrade, and him the most
splendid and boldest of warriors. Each mind caught fire from
the other, till the high enthusiasm of the one was quenched in
an early death.</p>

<p>‘Shortly after this friendship began, the course of events
also began which finally gave birth to the Oxford Movement.
The break-up of parties caused by the Roman Catholic Emancipation
was followed by the French and Belgian revolutions
of 1830, and these changes gave a fresh stimulus to all the
reforming parties in England: Whigs, Radicals, and Liberal
religionists. Froude’s letters mark the influence of these
changes on his mind. They stirred in him the fiercest disgust
and indignation, and as soon as the necessity of battle became
evident to save the Church (and such a necessity was evident)
he threw himself into it with all his heart, and his attitude was
henceforth that of a determined and uncompromising combatant.
“Froude is growing stronger and stronger in his
sentiments every day,” writes James Mozley, in 1832, “and
cuts about him on all sides. It is extremely fine to hear him
talk. The aristocracy of the country, at present, are the chief
objects of his vituperation, and he decidedly sets himself
against the modern character of the gentleman, and thinks
that the Church will eventually depend for its support, as it
always did in its most influential times, on the very poorest
classes.” “I would not set down anything that Froude says
for his deliberate opinion,” writes James Mozley a year later,
“for he really hates the present state of things so excessively
that any change would be a relief to him.” … “Froude is
staying up, and I see a great deal of him.” … “Froude is
most enthusiastic in his plans, and says, ‘What fun it is living
<!--285.png--><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><span class="pageno">249</span>
in such times as these! how could one now go back to the
times of old Tory humbug?’” From henceforth his position
among his friends was that of the most impatient and aggressive
of reformers, the one who most urged on his fellows to
outspoken language and a bold line of action. They were
not men to hang back and be afraid, but they were cautious
and considerate of popular alarms and prejudices, compared
with Froude’s fearlessness. Other minds were indeed moving,
minds as strong as his; indeed, it may be, deeper, more
complex, more amply furnished, with a wider range of vision
and a greater command of the field. But while he lived, he
appears as the one who spurs on and incites, where others
hesitate. He is the one by whom are visibly most felt the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gaudia certaminis</i>, and the confidence of victory, and the most
profound contempt for the men and the ideas of the boastful
and short-sighted present.</p>

<p>‘In this unsparing and absorbing warfare, what did Froude
aim at&mdash;what was the object he sought to bring about, what
were the obstacles he sought to overthrow?</p>

<p>‘He was accused, as was most natural, of Romanising: of
wishing to bring back Popery. It is perfectly certain that
this was not what he meant, though he did not care for the
imputation of it. He was, perhaps, the first Englishman who
attempted to do justice to Rome, and to use friendly language
of it, without the intention of joining it. But what he fought
for was not Rome, not even a restoration of Unity, but a
Church of England such as it was conceived of by the Caroline
divines and the Nonjurors. The great break-up of 1830 had
forced on men the anxious question: “What is the Church, as
spoken of in England? Is it the Church of Christ?” and the
answers were various. Hooker had said it was “the nation”;
and in entirely altered circumstances, with some qualifications,
Dr. Arnold said the same. It was “the Establishment,”
according to the lawyers and politicians, both Whig and Tory.
It was an invisible and mystical body, said the Evangelicals.
It was the aggregate of separate congregations, said the Nonconformists.
It was the Parliamentary creation of the Reformation,
said the Erastians. The true Church was the communion
of the Pope, the pretended Church was a legalised
<!--286.png--><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><span class="pageno">250</span>
schism, said the Roman Catholics. All these ideas were
floating about, loose and vague, among people who talked
much about the Church. Whately, with his clear sense, had
laid down that it was a divine religious society, distinct in its
origin and existence, distinct in its attributes from any other.
But this idea had fallen dead, till Froude and his friends put
new life into it. Froude accepted Whately’s idea that the
Church of England was the one historic uninterrupted Church,
than which there could be no other, locally, in England; but
into this Froude read a great deal that never was and never
could be in Whately’s thoughts. Whately had gone very far
in viewing the Church, from without, as a great and sacred
corporate body. Casting aside the Erastian theory, he had
claimed its right to exist, and if necessary, govern itself,
separate from the State. He had recognised excommunication
as its natural and indefeasible instrument of government. But
what the internal life of the Church was, what should be its
teaching and organic system, and what was the standard and
proof of these, Whately had left unsaid. And this outline
Froude filled up. For this he went the way to which the
Prayer-Book, with its Offices, its Liturgy, its Ordination
services, pointed him. With the divines who had specially
valued the Prayer-Book, and taught in its spirit, Bishop
Wilson, William Law, Hammond, Ken, Laud, Andrewes, he
went back to the times and the sources from which the Prayer-Book
came to us, the early Church, the Reforming Church (for
such, with all its faults, it was), of the eleventh, twelfth, and
thirteenth centuries, before the hopelessly corrupt and fatal
times of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, which led to
the break-up of the sixteenth. Thus, to the great question,
What is the Church? he gave without hesitation, and gave to
the end, the same answer that Anglicans gave and are giving
still. But he added two points which were then very new to
the ears of English Churchmen: (1) that there were great and
to most people unsuspected faults and shortcomings in the
English Church, for some of which the Reformation was
gravely responsible; (2) that the Roman Church was more
right than we had been taught to think, in many parts both
of principle and practice, and that our quarrel with it on these
<!--287.png--><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><span class="pageno">251</span>
points arose from our own ignorance and prejudices. To
people who had taken for granted all their lives that the
Church was thoroughly “Protestant” and thoroughly right in
its Protestantism, and that Rome was Antichrist, these confident
statements came with a shock. He did not enter much
into dogmatic questions. As far as can be judged from his
<cite>Remains</cite>, the one point of doctrine on which he laid stress, as
being inadequately recognised and taught in the then condition
of the English Church, was the Primitive doctrine of the
Eucharist. His other criticisms pointed to practical and moral
matters: the spirit of Erastianism, the low standard of life and
purpose and self-discipline in the clergy, the low tone of the
current religious teaching. The Evangelical teaching seemed
to him a system of unreal words. The opposite school was too
self-complacent, too comfortable, too secure in its social and
political alliances; and he was bent on shaming people into
severer notions. “We will have a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vocabularium apostolicum</i>,
and I will start it with four words: ‘pampered aristocrats,’
‘resident gentlemen,’ ‘smug parsons,’ and ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pauperes Christi</i>.’
I shall use the first on all occasions; it seems to me just to
hit the thing.” “I think of putting the view forward (about
new monasteries), under the title of a ‘Project for Reviving
Religion in Great Towns.’ Certainly colleges of unmarried
priests (who might, of course, retire to a living, when they
could and liked) would be the cheapest possible way of providing
effectively for the spiritual wants of a large population.”
And his great quarrel with the existing state of things was
that the spiritual objects of the Church were overlaid and lost
sight of in the anxiety not to lose its political position. In
this direction he was, as he proclaims himself, an out-and-out
Radical, and he was prepared at once to go very far. “If a
National Church means a Church without discipline, my
argument for discipline is an argument against a National
Church; and the best thing we can do is to unnationalise ours
as soon as possible”; “let us tell the truth and shame the
devil: let us give up a <em>National</em> Church and have a <em>real</em> one.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_306" id="fnanchor_306"></a><a href="#footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></span>
His criticism did not diminish in severity, or his proposals
become less daring, as he felt that his time was growing short
<!--288.png--><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a><span class="pageno">252</span>
and the hand of death was upon him. But to the end, the
elevation and improvement of the English Church remained
his great purpose. To his friend, as we know, the Roman
Church was either the Truth or Antichrist. To Froude it was
neither the whole Truth nor Antichrist; but like the English
Church itself, a great and defective Church, whose defects were
the opposite to ours, and which we should do wisely to learn
from, rather than abuse. But, to the last, his allegiance never
wavered to the English Church.</p>

<p>‘It is very striking to come from Froude’s boisterous
freedom in his letters, to his sermons and the papers he prepared
for publication. In his sermons his manner of writing
is severe and restrained even to dryness. If they startle, it
is by the force and searching point of an idea, not by any
strength of words. The style is chastened, simple, calm, with
the most careful avoidance of over-statement or anything
rhetorical. And so in his papers, his mode of argument,
forcible and cogent as it is, avoids all appearance of exaggeration
or even illustrative expansion: it is all muscle and sinew;
it is modelled on the argumentative style of Bishop Butler,
and still more, of William Law. No one could suppose from
these papers Froude’s fiery impetuosity, or the frank daring of
his disrespectful vocabulary. Those who can read between the
lines can trace the grave irony which clung everywhere to his
deep earnestness.</p>

<p>‘There was yet another side of Froude’s character which
was little thought of by his critics, or recognised by all his
friends. With all his keenness of judgment and all his readiness
for conflict, some who knew him best were impressed by
the melancholy which hung over his life, and which, though
he ignored it, they could detect. It is remembered still by
Cardinal Newman. “I thought,” wrote Mr. Isaac Williams,
“that knowing him, I better understood Hamlet, a person
most natural, but so original as to be unlike any one else,
hiding depth of delicate thought in apparent extravagances.
<cite>Hamlet</cite>, and the <cite>Georgics</cite> of Virgil, he used to say, he should
have bound together.” “Isaac Williams,” wrote Mr. Copeland,
“mentioned to me a remark made on Froude by S. Wilberforce
in his early days: ‘They talk of Froude’s fun, but somehow I
<!--289.png--><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a><span class="pageno">253</span>
cannot be in a room with him alone for ten minutes without
feeling so intensely melancholy, that I do not know what to do
with myself. At Brighstone, in my Eden days, he was with
me, and I was overwhelmed with the deep sense which possessed
him of yearning which nothing could satisfy, and of the
unsatisfying nature of all things.’”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_307" id="fnanchor_307"></a><a href="#footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Froude often reminds us of Pascal. Both had that
peculiarly bright, brilliant, sharp-cutting intellect which passes
with ease through the coverings and disguises which veil
realities from men. Both had mathematical powers of unusual
originality and clearness; both had the same imaginative
faculty; both had the same keen interest in practical problems
of science; both felt and followed the attraction of deeper and
more awful interests. Both had the same love of beauty;
both suppressed it. Both had the same want of wide or deep
learning; they made skilful use of what books came to their
hand, and used their reading as few readers are able to use it;
but their real instrument of work was their own quick and
strong insight, and power of close and vigorous reasoning.
Both had the greatest contempt for fashionable and hollow
“shadows of religion.” Both had the same definite, unflinching
judgment. Both used the same clear and direct language.
Both had a certain grim delight in the irony with which they
pursued their opponents. In both it is probable that their
unmeasured and unsparing criticism recoiled on the cause
which they had at heart. But in the case of both of them it
was not the temper of the satirist, it was no mere love of
attacking what was vulnerable, and indulgence in the cruel
pleasure of stinging and putting to shame, which inspired
them. Their souls were moved by the dishonour done to
religion, by public evils and public dangers. Both of them
died young, before their work was done. They placed before
themselves the loftiest and most unselfish objects, the restoration
of truth and goodness in the Church: and to that they
gave their life and all that they had. And what they called
on others to be they were themselves. They were alike in
<!--290.png--><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><span class="pageno">254</span>
the sternness, the reality, the perseverance, almost unintelligible
in its methods to ordinary men, of their moral and spiritual
self-discipline.’</p>

<p>‘Hurrell Froude was, when I, as an undergraduate, first knew
him, in 1828, tall and very thin, with something of a stoop,
with a large skull and forehead, but not a large face, delicate
features, and penetrating grey eyes, not exactly piercing, but
bright with internal conceptions, and ready to assume an
expression of amusement, careful attention, inquiry, or stern
disgust, but with a basis of softness. His manner was cordial
and familiar, and assured you, as you knew him well, of his
affectionate feeling, which encouraged you to speak your mind
(within certain limits), subject to the consideration that if you
said anything absurd it would not be allowed to fall to the
ground. He had more of the undergraduate in him than any
“don” whom I ever knew: absolutely unlike Newman in being
always ready to skate, sail, or ride with his friends, and, if in
<!--291.png--><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><span class="pageno">255</span>
a scrape, not pharisaical as to his means of getting out of it.
I remember, <i>e.g.</i>, climbing Merton gate with him in my undergraduate
days, when we had been out too late boating or
skating. And unless authority or substantial decorum was
really threatened he was very lenient: or, rather, had an
amused sympathy with the irregularities that are mere matters
of mischief or high spirits. In lecture it was, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mutatis mutandis</i>,
the same man. Seeing, from his <cite>Remains</cite>, the “high view of
his own capacities of which he could not divest himself,” and
his determination not to exhibit or be puffed up by it, and
looking back on his tutorial manner (I was in his lectures, both
in classics and mathematics), it was strange how he disguised,
not only his sense of superiority, but the appearance of it, so
that his pupils felt him more as a fellow-student than as the
refined scholar or mathematician which he was. This was
partly owing to his carelessness of those formulæ, the familiarity
with which gives even second-rate lectures a position of
superiority which is less visible in those who, like their pupils,
are themselves always struggling with principles; and partly
to an effort, perhaps sometimes overdone, not to put himself
above the level of others. In a lecture on the <cite>Supplices</cite> of
Æschylus, I have heard him say <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout bonnement</i>: “I can’t construe
that: what do you make of it, A. B.?” turning to the
supposed best scholar in the lecture; or, when an objection
was started to his mode of getting through a difficulty: “Ah!
I had not thought of that; perhaps your way is the best.”
And this mode of dealing with himself and the undergraduates
whom he liked, made them like him, but also made them really
undervalue his talent, which, as we now see, was what he
meant they should do. At the same time, though watchful
over his own vanity, he was keen and prompt in snubs in
playful and challenging retort, to those he liked, but in the
nature of scornful exposure, when he had to do with coarseness
or coxcombry, or shallow display of sentiment. It was a
paradoxical consequence of his suppression of egotism that
he was more solicitous to show that you were wrong than
that he was right. He also wanted, like Socrates or Bishop
Butler, to make others, if possible, think for themselves.</p>

<p>‘However, it is not to be inferred that his conversation was
<!--292.png--><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><span class="pageno">256</span>
made of controversy. To a certain extent it turned that way,
because he was fond of paradox. (His brother William used
to say that he, William, never felt he had really mastered a
principle till he had thrown it into a paradox.) And paradox,
of course, invites contradiction, and so controversy. On
subjects upon which he considered himself more or less an
apostle, he liked to stir people’s minds by what startled them,
waking them up, or giving them “nuts to crack.” An almost
solemn gravity, with amusement twinkling behind it (not
invisible, and ready to burst forth into a bright low laugh
when gravity had been played out), was a very frequent posture
with him. But he was thoroughly ready to amuse and instruct,
or to be amused and instructed, as an eager and earnest
speaker or listener on most matters of interest. I do not
remember that he had any great turn for beauty of colour; he
had none, I think, or next to none, for music, nor do I
remember in him any great love of humour; but for beauty
of physical form, for mechanics, for mathematics, for poetry
which had a root in true feeling, for wit (including that perception
of a quasi-logical absurdity of position), for history, for
domestic incidents, his sympathy was always lively, and he
would throw himself naturally and warmly into them. From
his general demeanour (I need scarcely say) the “odour of
sanctity” was wholly absent.</p>

<p>‘I am not sure that his height and depth of aim and lively
versatility of talent did not leave his compassionate sympathies
rather undeveloped; certainly to himself, and, I suspect, largely
in the case of others, he would view suffering not as a thing
to be cockered up or made much of, though of course to be
alleviated if possible, but to be viewed calmly as a Providential
discipline for those who can mitigate, or have to endure it.
J. H. N. was once reading me a letter just received from him
in which (in answer to J. H. N.’s account of his work and the
possibility of his breaking down), he said in substance: “I
daresay you have more to do than your health will bear, but
I would not have you give up anything except perhaps the
Deanery” (of Oriel). And then J. H. N. paused, with a kind
of inner exultant chuckle, and said: “Ah! there’s a Basil for
you”; as if the friendship which sacrificed its friend, as it would
<!--293.png--><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a><span class="pageno">257</span>
sacrifice itself, to a cause, was the friendship which was really
worth having.</p>

<p>‘As I came to know him in a more manly way, as a brother
Fellow, friend, and collaborateur, the character of “ecclesiastical
agitator” was of course added to this. In this capacity his
great pleasure was taking bulls by their horns. Like the
“gueux” of the Low Countries, he would have met half-way
any opprobrious nickname, and I believe coined the epithet
“Apostolical” for his party because it was connected with
everything in Spain which was most obnoxious to the British
public. I remember one day his grievously shocking Palmer
of Worcester, a man of an opposite texture, when a council in
J. H. N.’s rooms had been called to consider some memorial or
other to which Palmer wanted to collect the signatures of
many, and particularly of dignified persons, but in which
Froude wished to express the determined opinions of a few.
Froude stretched out his long length on Newman’s sofa, broke
in upon one of Palmer’s judicious harangues about Bishops
and Archdeacons and such like, with the ejaculation: “I don’t
see why we should disguise from ourselves that our object is
to dictate to the clergy of this country; and I, for one, do
not want anyone else to get on the box!” He thought
that true Churchmen must be few before they were many:
that the sin of the clergy in all ages was that they tried to
make out that Christians were many when they were only
few, and sacrificed to this object the force derivable from
downright and unmistakable enforcement of truth in speech or
action.</p>

<p>‘As simplicity in thought, word, and deed formed no small
part of his ideal, his tastes in architecture, painting, sculpture,
rhetoric, or poetry were severe. He had no patience with
what was artistically dissolute, luscious, or decorated more than
in proportion to its animating idea, wishy-washy, or sentimental.
The ornamental parts of his own rooms (in which I
lived in his absence) were a slab of marble to wash upon, a
print of Rubens’s “Deposition,” and a head (life-size) of the
Apollo Belvedere. And I remember still the tall scorn, with
something of surprise, with which, on entering my undergraduate
room, he looked down on some Venuses, Cupids,
<!--294.png--><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a><span class="pageno">258</span>
and Hebes, which, freshman-like, I had bought from an
Italian.</p>

<p>‘He was not very easy even under conventional vulgarity,
still less under the vulgarity of egotism; but, being essentially
a partisan, he could put up with both in a man who was really
in earnest and on the right side. Nothing, however, I think,
would have induced him to tolerate false sentiment, and he
would, I think, if he had lived, have exerted himself very
trenchantly to prevent his cause being adulterated by it. He
was, I should say, sometimes misled by a theory that genius
cut through a subject by logic or intuition, without looking to
the right or left, while common sense was always testing every
step by consideration of surroundings (I have not got his terse
mode of statement), and that genius was right, or at least had
only to be corrected, here and there, by common sense. This,
I take it, would hardly have answered if his trenchancy had
not been in practice corrected by J. H. N.’s wider political
circumspection. He submitted, I suppose, to J. H. N.’s axiom,
that if the Movement was to do anything it must become
“respectable”; but it was against his nature.</p>

<p>‘He would (as we see in the <cite>Remains</cite>) have wished Ken to
have the “courage of his convictions” by excommunicating the
Jurors in William <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></span>’s time, and setting up a little Catholic
Church, like the Jansenists in Holland. He was not (as has
been observed) a theologian, but he was as jealous for orthodoxy
as if he were. He spoke slightingly of Heber as having
ignorantly or carelessly communicated with Monophysites.
But he probably knew no more about that and other heresies
than a man of active and penetrating mind would derive from
text-books. And I think it likely enough, not that his
reverence for the Eucharist, but that his special attention to
the details of Eucharistic doctrine, was due to the consideration
that it was the foundation of ecclesiastical discipline and
authority: matters on which his mind fastened itself with
enthusiasm.’</p>

<p>‘… Hurrell Froude was a pupil of Keble’s, formed by
him, and in turn reacting upon him. I knew him first in 1826,
and was in the closest and most affectionate friendship with
him from about 1829 until his death in 1836. He was a man
of the highest gifts: so truly many-sided, that it would be
presumptuous in me to attempt to describe him, except under
those aspects in which he came before me. Nor have I here
to speak of the gentleness and tenderness of nature, the
playfulness, the free elastic force and graceful versatility of
mind, and the patient winning considerateness in discussion,
which endeared him to those to whom he opened his heart;
for I am all along engaged upon matters of belief and opinion,
and am introducing others into my narrative, not for their own
sake, or because I love them and have loved them, so much as
because, and so far as, they have influenced my theological
views. In this respect, then, I speak of Hurrell Froude, in his
intellectual aspect: as a man of high genius, brimful and
overflowing with ideas and views, in him original, which were
too many and strong even for his bodily strength, and which
crowded and jostled against each other, in their effort after
distinct shape and expression. And he had an intellect as
critical and logical as it was speculative and bold. Dying
prematurely, as he did, and in the conflict and transition-state
of opinion, his religious views never reached their ultimate
conclusion, by the very reason of their multitude and their
depth. His opinions arrested and influenced me even when
they did not gain my assent. He professed openly his
admiration of the Church of Rome, and his hatred of the
Reformers. He delighted in the notion of an hierarchical
system, of sacerdotal power, and of full ecclesiastical liberty.
He felt scorn of the maxim, “The Bible and the Bible only
is the religion of Protestants,” and he gloried in accepting
<!--296.png--><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a><span class="pageno">260</span>
Tradition as a main instrument of religious teaching. He
had a high severe idea of the intrinsic excellence of Virginity,
and he considered the Blessed Virgin its great Pattern.
He delighted in thinking of the Saints; he had a vivid
appreciation of the idea of sanctity, its possibility and its
heights; and he was more than inclined to believe a large
amount of miraculous interference as occurring in the early
and middle ages. He embraced the principle of penance
and mortification. He had a deep devotion to the Real
Presence, in which he had a firm faith. He was powerfully
drawn to the Mediæval Church, but not to the
Primitive.</p>

<p>‘He had a keen insight into abstract truth; but he was an
Englishman to the backbone in his severe adherence to the
real and the concrete. He had a most classical taste, and a
genius for philosophy and art; and he was fond of historical
inquiry, and the politics of religion. He had no turn for
theology as such. He set no sufficient value on the writings
of the Fathers, on the detail or development of doctrine, on
the definite traditions of the Church viewed in their matter, on
the teaching of the Ecumenical Councils, or on the controversies
out of which they arose. He took an eager courageous
view of things, on the whole. I should say that his power of
entering into the minds of others did not equal his other gifts:
he could not believe, for instance, that I really held the Roman
Church to be anti-Christian. On many points, he would not
believe but that I agreed with him, when I did not: he seemed
not to understand my difficulties. His were of a different
kind: the contrariety between theory and fact. He was a
High Tory of the Cavalier stamp, and was disgusted with the
Toryism of the opponents of the Reform Bill. He was smitten
with the love of the Theocratic Church: he went abroad, and
was shocked by the degeneracy which he thought he saw in
the Catholics of Italy.</p>

<p>‘It is difficult to enumerate the precise additions to my
theological creed which I derived from a friend to whom I owe
so much. He taught me to look with admiration towards the
Church of Rome, and, in the same degree, to dislike the
Reformation. He fixed deep in me the idea of devotion to
<!--297.png--><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a><span class="pageno">261</span>
the Blessed Virgin, and he led me gradually to believe in the
Real Presence.</p>

<p>‘There were other reasons, besides Mr. Rose’s state of
health, which hindered those who so much admired him from
availing themselves of his close co-operation in the coming
fight. United as both he and they were in the general scope
of the Movement, they were in discordance with each other,
from the first, in their estimate of the means to be adopted for
attaining it. Mr. Rose had a position in the Church, a name,
and serious responsibilities; he had direct ecclesiastical
superiors; he had intimate relations with his own University,
and a large clerical connection through the country. Froude
and I were nobodies, with no characters to lose, and no
antecedents to fetter us. Rose could not go ahead across
country, as Froude had no scruples in doing. Froude was a
bold rider: as on horseback, so also in his speculations. After
a long conversation with him on the logical bearing of his
principles, Mr. Rose said of him, with quiet humour, that “he
did not seem to be afraid of inferences.” It was simply the
truth. Froude had that strong hold of first principles, and
that keen perception of their value, that he was comparatively
indifferent to the revolutionary action which would attend on
their application to a given state of things; whereas, in the
thoughts of Rose, as a practical man, existing facts had the
precedence of every other idea, and the chief test of the
soundness of a line of policy lay in the consideration whether
it would work. This was one of the first questions which, as
it seemed to me, on every occasion occurred to his mind.
With Froude, Erastianism, that is, the union (so he viewed it)
of Church and State, was the parent, or if not the parent, the
serviceable and sufficient tool of Liberalism. Till that union
was snapped, Christian doctrine never could be safe; and
while he well knew how high and unselfish was the temper
of Mr. Rose, yet he used to apply to him an epithet,
reproachful in his mouth: Rose was “a conservative.” By
bad luck, I brought out this word to Mr. Rose in a letter of
my own, which I wrote to him in criticism of something he
had inserted in his Magazine: I got a vehement rebuke for my
<!--298.png--><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a><span class="pageno">262</span>
pains; for though Rose pursued a conservative line, he had as
high a disdain as Froude could have of a worldly ambition,
and an extreme sensitiveness of such an imputation. But
there was another reason still, and a more elementary one,
which severed Mr. Rose from the Oxford Movement. Living
movements do not come of committees, nor are great ideas
worked out through the post, even though it had been the
penny post. This principle deeply penetrated both Froude
and myself from the first, and recommended to us the course
which things soon took spontaneously, and without set purpose
of our own.</p>

<p>‘It was an apparent accident which introduced me to [the
Roman Breviary], that most wonderful and most attractive
monument of the devotion of Saints. On Hurrell Froude’s
death, in 1836, I was asked to select one of his books as a
keepsake. I selected Butler’s <cite>Analogy</cite>; finding that it had
been already chosen, I looked with some perplexity along the
shelves, as they stood before me, when an intimate friend at
my elbow said: “Take that.” It was the Breviary which
Hurrell had had with him at Barbados. Accordingly, I
took it, studied it, wrote my Tract from it, and have it on
my table in constant use till this day.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_309" id="fnanchor_309"></a><a href="#footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></span> That dear and familiar

<p>‘… In obedience to the general law of human affairs,
arrived the day of reaction. A new race of students had
<!--300.png--><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><span class="pageno">264</span>
grown up at Oxford. They were men of unsullied, and even
severe virtue; animated by a devotion which, if not very
fervent, was at least genuine and grave; conversant with
classical literature, and not without pretensions, more or less
considerable, to an acquaintance with Christian antiquity. As
they paced thoughtfully along those tall avenues, to which, a
hundred years before, Whitfield and the Wesleys had been
accustomed to retire for meditation, they recoiled, with a
mixture of aversion and contempt, from the image of the
crowded assemblages, and the dramatic exercises, in which
the successors of those great men in the Church of England
were performing so conspicuous a part. They revolved, not
without indignation, the intellectual barrenness with which
that Church had been stricken, from the time when her most
popular teachers had not merely been satisfied to tread the
narrow circle of the “Evangelical” theology, but had exulted
in that bondage as indicating their possession of a purer light
than had visited the other ministers of the Gospel. They
invoked, with an occasional sigh, but not without many a
bitter smile, the reappearance amongst us of a piety more
profound and masculine, more meek and contemplative. They
believed that such a change in the religious character of their
age and country was a divine command, and that a commission
had been given to themselves to carry it into effect.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘… It came to pass, in the Oxonian as in other
leagues, that the head moved forward by the impulse of the
tail. Step by step in their progress, “the Church,” whom
they worshipped, changed her attitude and her aspect. She
soon disclaimed her Elizabethan or statutory origin, and then
made vehement efforts to escape from her Elizabethan or
statutory ceremonial. She assumed the title, and laid claim
to the character, of the Primitive Church, or the Church of the
Fathers, and at length arrogated to herself the prerogatives of
that Catholic or universal Church, which “lifts her mitred front
<!--301.png--><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a><span class="pageno">265</span>
in courts and palaces,” whether at Rome, at Moscow, or at Lambeth,
but whose presence is never vouchsafed to any who cannot
trace back from Apostolic hands an Episcopal succession.</p>

<p>‘At this stage of the history of the Oxonian league, its
progress was quickened and animated by the panic which
exhibited itself from one end to the other of the hostile camp.
The disciples of Whitfield and of Wesley, united to those of
Newton and Scott, of Milner and of Venn, and, reinforced by
the whole strength of the Nonconformists, began to throw up,
along the whole field of controversy, entrenchments for their
own defence, and batteries for the annoyance of their assailants.
Amongst the literary missiles cast by the contending hosts
against each other, there are few better worth the study of
those who wish to estimate the probable result of the conflict,
than the <cite>Life</cite> of Richard Hurrell Froude. It was launched
from a catapult under the immediate direction of Messrs.
Keble and Newman themselves, and, though it is a book of
no great inherent value, it has a considerable interest as the
only biography which the world possesses of a confessor of
Oxford Catholicism. It contains a vivid picture of the discipline,
the studies, the opinions, and the mental habits of his
fraternity, and is published by the two great fathers of that
school, with the avowal of their “own general coincidence”
in the opinions and feelings of their disciple. We have thus
a delineation, at full length, of one of those divines who are
to effect the conquest which was attempted in vain by the
Bellarmines and the Bossuets of former times. If it teaches
us nothing else, this biography will at least teach us what is
the real extent and urgency of the danger which has so much
disturbed the tranquillity of the guardians of the Protestant
faith of England.</p>

<p>‘Richard Hurrell Froude was born, as we read, on the
“Feast of the Annunciation,” in the year 1803, and died in
1836. He was an Etonian, a Fellow of Oriel College, a
priest in Holy Orders of the Church of England, the writer
of unsuccessful prize essays, and of journals, letters, and
sermons; an occasional contributor to the periodical literature
of his theological associates; and, during the last four years
of his life, an invalid in search of health, either in the south
<!--302.png--><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a><span class="pageno">266</span>
of Europe or in the West Indies. Such are all the incidents
of a life to the commemoration of which two octavo volumes
have been dedicated. A more intractable story, if regarded
merely as a narrative, was never undertaken. But Mr. Froude
left behind him a great collection of papers, which affection
would have committed to the fire, though party spirit has
given them to the press. The most unscrupulous publisher
of diaries and private correspondence never offered for sale a
self-analysis more frank or less prepossessing. But the world
is invited to gaze on this suicidal portraiture, on account of
“the extreme importance of the views, to the development of
which the whole is meant to be subservient,” and in order
that they may not lose “the instruction derivable from a full
exhibition of his character as a witness to those views.” Heavy
as are the penalties which the Editors of these volumes have
incurred for their disclosure of the infirmities of their friend,
the world will probably absolve them if they will publish more
of the letters which he appears to have received from his
mother, and to have transmitted to them. One such letter
which they have rescued from oblivion, is worth far more than
all which they have published of her son’s. Though both the
parent and the child have long since been withdrawn from the
reach of this world’s judgment, it yet seems almost an impiety
to transcribe her estimate of his early character, and to add that
the less favourable anticipations which she drew from her study
of him in youth, were but too distinctly verified in his riper
years. She read his heart with a mother’s sagacity, and thus
revealed it to himself with a mother’s tenderness and truth.</p>

<p>‘“From his very birth his temper had been peculiar;
pleasing, intelligent, and attaching, when his mind was undisturbed,
and he was in the company of people who treated
him reasonably and kindly; but exceedingly impatient under
vexatious circumstances; very much disposed to find his own
amusement in teasing and vexing others; and almost entirely
incorrigible when it was necessary to reprove him. I never
could find a successful mode of treating him. Harshness
made him obstinate and gloomy; calm and long displeasure
made him stupid and sullen; and kind patience had not
sufficient power over his feelings to force him to govern himself.
<!--303.png--><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a><span class="pageno">267</span>
After a statement of such great faults, it may seem an
inconsistency to say that he nevertheless still bore about him
strong marks of a promising character. In all points of substantial
principle his feelings were just and high. He had
(for his age) an unusually deep feeling of admiration for
everything which was good and noble; his relish was lively,
and his taste good, for all the pleasures of the imagination;
and he was also quite conscious of his own faults, and (<em>untempted</em>)
had a just dislike to them.”’</p>

<p>‘Exercising a stern and absolute dominion over all the
baser passions, with a keen perception of the beautiful in
nature and in art, and a deep homage for the sublime in
morals; imbued with the spirit of the classical authors, and
delighting in the exercise of talents which, though they fell far
short of excellence, rose as far above mediocrity, Mr. Froude
might have seemed to want no promise of an honourable rank
in literature, or of distinction in his sacred office. His career
was intercepted by a premature death; but enough is recorded
to show that his aspirations, however noble, must have been
defeated by the pride and moroseness which his mother’s
wisdom detected, and which her love disclosed to him; united
as they were to a constitutional distrust of his own powers,
and a weak reliance on other minds for guidance and support.
A spirit at once haughty, and unsustained by genuine self-confidence;
subdued by the stronger will or intellect of other
men, and glorying in that subjection; regarding the opponents
of his masters with an intolerance exceeding their own; and,
in the midst of all his animosity towards others, turning with
no infrequent indignation on itself,&mdash;might form the basis of a
good dramatic sketch, of which Mr. Froude might not unworthily
sustain the burden. But a “dialogue of the dead,” in
which George Whitfield and Richard Froude should be the
interlocutors, would be a more appropriate channel for
illustrating the practical uses of “the Second Reformation,” and
of the “Catholic Restoration,” which it is the object of their
respective biographies to illustrate. Rhadamanthus having
dismissed them from his tribunal, they would compare
together their juvenile admiration of the drama, their ascetic
discipline at Oxford, their early dependence on stronger or
<!--304.png--><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a><span class="pageno">268</span>
more resolute minds, their propensity to self-observation and
to self-portraiture, their contemptuous opinions of the negro
race, and the surprise with which they witnessed the worship
of the Church of Rome in lands where it is still triumphant.
So far all is peace, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">concordes animæ</i> exchange such
greetings as pass between disembodied spirits. But when the
tidings brought by the new denizen of the Elysian fields to the
reformer of the eighteenth century, reach his affrighted shade,
the regions of the blessed are disturbed by an unwonted discord;
and the fiery soul of Whitfield blazes with intense desire
to resume his wanderings through the earth, and to lift up his
voice against the new apostasy.</p>

<p>‘It was with no unmanly dread of the probe, but from
want of skill or leisure to employ it, that the self-scrutiny of
Whitfield seldom or never penetrated much below the surface.
Preach he must; and when no audience could be brought
together, he seized a pen and preached to himself. The
uppermost feeling, be it what it may, is put down in his
journal honestly, vigorously, and devoutly. Satan is menaced
and upbraided. Intimations from Heaven are recorded, without
one painful doubt of their origin. He prays and exults,
anticipates the future with delight, looks back to the past with
thankfulness, blames himself simply because he thinks himself
to blame, despairs of nothing, fears nothing, and has not a
moment’s ill-will to any human being. Mr. Froude conducts
his written soliloquies in a different spirit. His introverted
gaze analyses with elaborate minuteness the various motives
at the confluence of which his active powers receive their
impulse, and, with perverted sagacity, pursues the self-examination,
until, bewildered in the dark labyrinth of his own
nature, he escapes to the cheerful light of day by locking
up his journal. A friend (whose real name is as distinctly
intimated under its initial letter, as if it were written at length)
advises burning confessions. “I cannot make up my mind to
that,” observes the penitent; “but I think I can see many
points in which it will be likely to do me good to be cut off
for some time from these records.” On such a subject the
author of <cite>The Christian Year</cite> was entitled to greater deference.
That bright ornament of the College <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Propagandâ</i> at
<!--305.png--><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><span class="pageno">269</span>
Oxford had also gazed on his own heart through the mental
microscope, till he had learnt the danger of the excessive use
of it. While admonishing men to approach their Creator not
as isolated beings, but as members of the Universal Church,
and while aiding the inmates of her hallowed courts to
worship in strains so pure, so reverent, and so meek, as to
answer not unworthily to the voice of hope and reconciliation
in which she is addressed by her Divine Head, this “sweet
singer” had so brooded over the evanescent processes of his
own spiritual nature, as not seldom to render his real meaning
imperceptible to his readers, and probably to himself. With
how sound a judgment he counselled Mr. Froude to burn his
books, may be judged from the following entries in them:</p>

<p>‘“I have been talking a great deal to P.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_314" id="fnanchor_314"></a><a href="#footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></span> about religion
to-day. He seems to take such straightforward practical views
of it that, when I am talking to him, I wonder what I have
been bothering myself with all the summer, and almost doubt
how far it is right to allow myself to indulge in speculations
on a subject where all that is necessary is so plain and
obvious.”&mdash;“Yesterday, when I went out shooting, I fancied
I did not care whether I hit or not; but when it came to the
point, I found myself anxious, and, after having killed, was not
unwilling to let myself be considered a better shot than I
described myself. I had an impulse, too, to let it be thought
that I had only three shots when I really had had four. It
was slight, to be sure, but I felt it.”&mdash;“I have read my journal,
though I can hardly identify myself with the person it
describes. It seems like having someone under one’s
guardianship who was an intolerable fool, and exposed himself
to my contempt, every moment, for the most ridiculous and
trifling motives; and while I was thinking all this, I went into
L.’s room to seek a pair of shoes, and on hearing him coming,
got away as silently as possible. Why did I do this? Did I
think I was doing what L. did not like? or was it the relic of
a sneaking habit? I will ask myself these questions again.”&mdash;“I
have a sort of vanity which aims at my own good opinion,
and I look for anything to prove to myself that I am more
<!--306.png--><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a><span class="pageno">270</span>
anxious to mind myself than other people. I was very
hungry, but because I thought the charge unreasonable, I
tried to shirk the waiter: sneaking!”&mdash;“Yesterday I was
much put out by an old fellow chewing tobacco and spitting
across me; also bad thoughts of various kinds kept presenting
themselves to my mind when it was vacant.”&mdash;“I talked
sillily to-day, as I used to do last Term, but took no pleasure
in it, so I am not ashamed. Although I don’t recollect any
harm of myself, yet I don’t feel that I have made a clean
breast of it.”&mdash;“I forgot to mention that I had been looking
round my rooms, and thinking that they looked comfortable
and nice, and that I said in my heart, ‘Ah, ah! I am warm.’”&mdash;“It
always suggests itself to me that a wise thought is wasted
when it is kept to myself, against which, as it is my most
bothering temptation, I will set down some arguments to be
called to mind in time of trouble.”&mdash;“Now I am proud of this,
and think that the knowledge it shows of myself implies a
greatness of mind.”&mdash;“These records are no guide to me to
show the state of my mind afterwards; they are so far from
being exercises of humility, that they lessen the shame of what
I record, just as professions [of] goodwill to other people
reconcile us to our neglect of them.”</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘As it is not by these nice self-observers that the creeds of
hoar antiquity, and the habits of centuries are to be shaken;
so neither is such high emprise reserved for ascetics who can
pause to enumerate the slices of bread and butter from which
they have abstained. When Whitfield would mortify his
body, he set about it like a man. The paroxysm was short
indeed, but terrible. While it lasted, his diseased imagination
brought soul and body into deadly conflict, the fierce spirit
spurning, trampling, and well-nigh destroying the peccant
carcase. Not so the fastidious and refined “witness to the
views” of the restorers of the Catholic Church. The strife
between his spiritual and animal nature is recorded in his
journal in such terms as these: “Looked with greediness to
see if there was goose on the table for dinner.”&mdash;“Meant
to have kept a fast and did abstain from dinner, but at tea
eat buttered toast.”&mdash;“Tasted nothing to-day till tea-time, and
<!--307.png--><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a><span class="pageno">271</span>
then only one cup and dry bread.”&mdash;“I have kept my fast
strictly, having taken nothing till near nine this evening, and
then only a cup of tea and a little bread without butter,
but it has not been as easy as it was last.”&mdash;“I made rather a
more hearty tea than usual, quite giving up the notion of a
fast in W.’s rooms, and by this weakness have occasioned
another slip.” Whatever may be thought of the propriety of
disclosing such passages as these, they will provoke a contemptuous
smile from no one who knows much of his own
heart. But they may relieve the anxiety of the alarmists.
Luther and Zwingle, Cranmer and Latimer, may still rest in
their honoured graves. “Take courage, brother Ridley, we
shall light up such a flame in England as shall not soon be put
out!” is a prophecy which will not be defeated by the successors
of the Oxonian divines who listened to it, so long as
they shall be [able?]<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_315" id="fnanchor_315"></a><a href="#footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></span> to record, and to publish, contrite
reminiscences of a desire for roasted goose, and of an undue
indulgence in buttered toast.</p>

<p>‘Yet the will to subvert the doctrines and discipline of
the Reformation is not wanting, and is not concealed. Mr.
Froude himself, were he still living, might, indeed, object to be
judged by his careless and familiar Letters. No such objection
can, however, be made by the eminent persons who have
deliberately given them to the world on account “of the truth
and extreme importance of the views to which the whole is
meant to be subservient,” and in which they record their “own
general concurrence.” Of these weighty truths take the
following examples: “You will be shocked at my avowal
that I am every day becoming a less and less loyal son of the
Reformation. It appears to me plain that in all matters
which seem to us indifferent, or even doubtful, we should
conform our practices to those of the Church which has preserved
its traditionary practices unbroken. We cannot know
about any seemingly indifferent practice of the Church of
Rome that it is not a development of the Apostolic <ins title="êthos">ἦθος</ins>, and it
is to no purpose to say that we can find no proof of it in the
writings of the first six centuries: they must find a disproof if
they would do anything.”&mdash;“I think people are injudicious
<!--308.png--><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a><span class="pageno">272</span>
who talk against the Roman Catholics for worshipping Saints
and honouring the Virgin and images, etc. These things may
perhaps be idolatrous: I cannot make up my mind about it.”&mdash;“P.
called us the Papal Protestant Church, in which he
proved a double ignorance, as we are Catholics without the
Popery, and Church of England men without the Protestantism.”&mdash;“The
more I think over that view of yours about regarding
our present Communion Service, etc., as a judgement on the
Church, and taking it as the crumbs from the Apostles’ table,
the more I am struck with its fitness to be dwelt upon as
tending to check the intrusion of irreverent thoughts, without
in any way interfering with one’s just indignation.”&mdash;“Your
trumpery principle about Scripture being the sole rule of faith
in fundamentals (I nauseate the word), is but a mutilated
edition, without the breadth and axiomatic character, of the
original.”&mdash;“Really I hate the Reformation and the Reformers
more and more, and have almost made up my mind that the
Rationalist spirit they set afloat is the <ins title="pseudoprophêtês">ψευδοπροφήτης</ins> of the
Revelations.”&mdash;“Why do you praise Ridley? Do you know
sufficient good about him to counterbalance the fact that he
was the associate of Cranmer, Peter Martyr, and Bucer?”&mdash;“I
wish you could get to know something of S. and W.” (Southey
and Wordsworth), “and un-Protestantise, un-Miltonise them.”&mdash;“<cite>How
is it</cite> <span class="smaller">WE</span> <cite>are so much in advance of our generation?</cite>”
Spirit of George Whitfield! how would thy voice, rolled from
“the secret place of thunders,” have overwhelmed these puny
protests against the truths which it was the one business of thy
life to proclaim from the rising to the setting sun!</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘Penetrating the design and seizing the spirit of the Gospels,
the Reformers inculcated the faith in which the sentient and the
spiritual in man’s compound nature had each its appropriate
office: the one directed to the Redeemer in His palpable form,
the other to the Divine Paraclete in His hidden agency; while,
united with these, they exhibited to a sinful, but penitent, race
the parental character of the omnipresent Deity. Such is not
the teaching of the restored theology. The most eminent of
its professors have thrown open the doors of Mr. Froude’s
oratory, and have invited all passers-by to notice in his prayers
<!--309.png--><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a><span class="pageno">273</span>
and meditations “the absence of any distinct mention of our
Lord and Saviour.” They are exhorted not to doubt that
there was a real though silent “allusion to Christ” under the
titles in which the Supreme Being is addressed; and are told
that “this circumstance may be a comfort to those who cannot
bring themselves to assume the tone of many popular writers
of this day, who yet are discouraged by the peremptoriness
with which it is exacted of them. The truth is, that a mind
alive to its own real state often shrinks to utter what it most
dwells upon; and is too full of awe and fear to do more than
silently hope what it most wishes.”</p>

<p>‘It would indeed be presumptuous to pass a censure, or to
hazard an opinion, on the private devotions of any man; but
there is no such risk in rejecting the apology which the
publishers of those secret exercises have advanced for Mr.
Froude’s departure from the habits of his fellow-Christians.
Feeble, indeed, and emasculate must be the system, which, in its
delicate distaste for the “popular writers of the day,” would
bury in silence the Name in which every tongue and language
has been summoned to worship and to rejoice. Well may
“awe and fear” become all who assume and all who invoke it.
But an “awe” which “shrinks to utter”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_316" id="fnanchor_316"></a><a href="#footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></span> the Name of Him Who
was born at Bethlehem, and yet does not fear to use the
Name which is ineffable; a “fear” which can make mention of
the Father, but may not speak of the Brother, of all;&mdash;is a
feeling which fairly baffles comprehension. There is a much
more simple though a less imposing theory. Mr. Froude
permitted himself, and was encouraged by his correspondents,
to indulge in the language of antipathy and scorn towards a
large body of his fellow-Christians. It tinges his Letters, his
Journals, and is not without its influence even on his devotions.
Those despised men too often celebrated the events of their
Redeemer’s life, and the benefits of His Passion, in language of
offensive familiarity, and invoked Him with fond and feeble
epithets. Therefore, a good Oxford Catholic must envelope
in mystic terms all allusion to Him round Whom, as its
centre, the whole Christian system revolves. The line of
demarcation between themselves and these coarse sentimentalists
<!--310.png--><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a><span class="pageno">274</span>
must be broad and deep, even though it should exclude
those by whom it is drawn, from all the peculiar and distinctive
ground on which the standard of the reformed Churches has
been erected…. The martyrs of disgust and the heroes of
revolutions are composed of entirely opposite materials, and
are cast in quite different moulds. Nothing truly great or
formidable was ever yet accomplished, in thought or action, by
men whose love for truth was not strong enough to triumph
over their dislike of the offensive objects with which truth may
chance to be associated.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Froude was the helpless victim of such associations.
Nothing escapes his abhorrence which has been regarded with
favour by his political or religious antagonists. The Bill for
the Abolition of Slavery was recommended to Parliament by
an Administration more than suspected of Liberalism in
matters ecclesiastical. The “witness to Catholic views,” “in
whose sentiments, as a whole,” his Editors concur, visits the
West Indies, and they are not afraid to publish the following
report of his feelings: “I have felt it a kind of duty to maintain
in my mind an habitual hostility to the niggers, and to
chuckle over the failures of the new system, as if these poor
wretches concentrated in themselves all the Whiggery, dissent,
cant, and abomination that have been ranged on their side.”
Lest this should pass for a pleasant extravagance, the Editors
enjoin the reader not to “confound the author’s view of the
negro cause and of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">abstract negro</i> with his feelings towards
any he should actually meet”; and Professor Thöluck is summoned
from Germany to explain how the “originators of error”
may lawfully be the objects of a good man’s hate, and how it may
innocently overflow upon all their clients, kindred, and connections.
Mr. Froude’s feelings towards the “abstract negro”
would have satisfied the learned Professor in his most malevolent
mood. “I am ashamed,” he says, “I cannot get over my
prejudices against the niggers.”&mdash;“Every one I meet seems to
me like an incarnation of the whole Anti-Slavery Society, and
Fowell Buxton at their head.”&mdash;“The thing that strikes me as
most remarkable in the cut of these niggers is excessive immodesty,
a forward stupid familiarity intended for civility,
which prejudices me against them worse even than Buxton’s
<!--311.png--><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a><span class="pageno">275</span>
cant did. It is getting to be the fashion with everybody, even
the planters, to praise the emancipation and Mr. Stanley.”</p>

<p>‘Mr. Froude, or rather his Editors, appear to have fallen into
the error of supposing that their profession gives them not merely
the right to admonish, but the privilege to scold. Lord Stanley
and Mr. Buxton have, however, the consolation of being railed at
in good company. Hampden is “hated” with much zeal, though,
it is admitted, with imperfect knowledge. Louis Philippe, and
his associates of the Three Days, receive the following humane
benediction: “I sincerely hope ‘the march of mind’ in France
may yet prove a bloody one.”&mdash;“The election of the wretched
B. for &mdash;&mdash;, and that base fellow H. for &mdash;&mdash;, in spite of the
exposure,” etc. Again, the Editors protest against our supposing
that this is a playful exercise in the art of exaggeration.
“It should be observed,” they say, “as in other parts of
this volume, that the author used these words on principle, not
as abuse, but as expressing matters of fact, as a way of
bringing before his own mind things as they are.”</p>

<p>‘Milton, however, is the special object of Mr. Froude’s
virtuous abhorrence. He is “a detestable author.” Mr. Froude
rejoices to learn something of the Puritans, because, as he says,
“it gives me a better right to hate Milton, and accounts for
many of the things which most disgusted me in his (not-in-my-sense-of-the-word)
poetry!”&mdash;“A lady told me yesterday that
you wrote the article on Sacred Poetry, etc. I thought it
did not come up to what I thought your standard of aversion
to Milton.” … There are much better things in Mr. Froude’s
book than the preceding quotations might appear to promise.
If given as specimens of his powers, they would do injustice to
one whom we willingly would believe to have been a good and
able man, a ripe scholar, and a devout Christian; though as
illustrations of the temper and opinions of those who now sit in
Wycliffe’s seat, they are neither unfair nor unimportant. But
they may convince all whom it concerns, that hitherto, at
least, Oxford has not given birth to a new race of giants, by
whom the Evangelical founders and missionaries of the Church
of England are about to be expelled from their ancient
authority, or the Protestant world excluded from the light of
day and the free breath of Heaven.’</p>

<p class="center small">[By the kind permission of Messrs. J. Parker &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>]</p>

<p>‘Of Hurrell Froude Dr. Newman has written: “He was
a pupil of Keble’s, formed by him, and in turn reacting
upon him.” This sentence is followed by a short and striking
account of this extraordinary man, to which it would be
unwise in me to attempt any addition, except as it may bear
on the object of this memoir. I knew [Hurrell Froude] from
a child, and I trace in the somewhat singular composition of
his character, what he inherited both from his father, and his
highly gifted mother: his father, whom Keble after his first
visit to Dartington Parsonage playfully described to me as
“very amiable, but provokingly intelligent, one quite uncomfortable
to think of, making one ashamed of going
gawking as one is wont to do about the world, without
understanding anything one sees”; his mother very beautiful
in person and delicate in constitution, with a highly expressive
countenance, and gifted in intellect with the genius and
imagination which his father failed in. Like the one, he was
clever, knowing, quick, and handy; like the other, he was
sensitive, intellectual, imaginative. He came to Keble full of
respect for his character; he was naturally soon won by his
affectionateness and simplicity, and, in turn, he was just the
young man in whom Keble would at once take an interest
and delight, as pupil; and so in fact it was. I find him
again and again in Keble’s letters spoken of in the most
loving language, yet often not without some degree of anxiety
as to his future course: he saw the elements of danger in
him, how liable he might be to take a wrong course, or be
misunderstood even when taking a right one. Yet his hopes
largely prevailed; and especially I remember his rejoicing at
his [Froude’s] being elected Fellow of Oriel, thinking that
the new society and associations, with the responsibilities of
College employment, would tend to keep him safe. That
<!--313.png--><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a><span class="pageno">277</span>
Keble acted on him (I would rather use that term than
“formed”) is certain; and even when, in the later years of his
short life, symptoms of coming differences in opinion may be
traced in his letters, there is no abatement of personal love and
reverence, nor, indeed, in a certain sense, of his feeling the
weight of Keble’s influence; and though I gather from these
that there was more entire agreement with Dr. Newman as to
action, yet it seems to me that there still remained a closer
intimacy and more filial feeling with regard to Keble….</p>

<p>‘… That Hurrell Froude “re-acted on Keble” is true also,
I have no doubt, in a certain sense; it could scarcely be
otherwise where there was so much ability and affectionate
playfulness, with so much originality on one side; so much
humility on the other; and so much love on both. It would
be idle to speculate on what might have been, when the hour
of trial came which none of those specially engaged probably
then foresaw. Before it arrived, Hurrell Froude had sunk
under the constitutional malady against which he struggled
for four years. What he would have been, and what he
would have done, had his life been prolonged, no one can say;
it would be unfair to judge him by what he left behind, except
as rich grounds of promise. This I believe I may confidently
say, that those who knew him best loved him the most dearly,
and expected the most from him.</p>

<p>‘… My readers will have observed how Keble writes
respecting Hurrell Froude and his <cite>Remains</cite>. His death was
a heavy blow to him, and no wonder: those who knew him
but were not on terms of intimacy, could not but regard
mournfully the end of one so accomplished, so gifted, so good
and so pure; a man of such remarkable promise, worn out in
the very prime of life by slow, and wasting, and long-hopeless
disease. But it was much more than this with Keble: they
were more like elder and younger brothers. Reverence in
some sort sanctified Froude’s love for Keble, and moderated
the sallies of his somewhat too quick and defiant temper, and
imparted a special diffidence to his opposition, in their occasional
controversies with each other; while a sort of paternal
fondness in Keble gave unusual tenderness to his friendship
for Froude, and exaggerated, perhaps, his admiration for his
<!--314.png--><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a><span class="pageno">278</span>
undoubted gifts of head and heart. And these were greater
than mere acquaintances would be aware of: for he did not
present the best aspects of himself to common observation….</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘I had the misfortune of giving [Keble] pain, not only by
differing from him on the subject [of the <cite>Remains</cite>], but, owing
to misinformation, or misapprehension, on my part, by what
turned out to be a fruitless and ill-timed interference to prevent
the publication. I need not now explain how this arose;
but I must confess that my opinion remains unchanged.
It is a deeply interesting book; not only perfectly harmless
now, but capable of instructing and improving those who will
read it calmly and considerately. Still, I think that it was
calculated, at the time, to throw unnecessary difficulties in the
way of the Movement; that it tended to prevent a fair
consideration of what the “movers” were attempting, to excite
passion, and to encourage a scoffing spirit against them. Some
part of the anger and bitterness with which the Ninetieth
Tract was afterwards received, may fairly be traced to the
feeling created, unjustly indeed, but not unnaturally, by the
publication of the <cite>Remains</cite>. The one seemed to be the
result of the other, and the sequence of the two was held to
show a deliberate hostility to the Anglican, and an undue
preference of the Roman Church.’</p>

Mozley</span>, <abbr title="Doctor of Divinity">D.D.</abbr> Rivingtons, 1878. [From the Essay on
Dr. Arnold.]</p>

<p class="center small">[By the kind permission of Messrs. J. R. &amp; H. W. Mozley.]</p>

<p>‘The Church of England had, after a century of growing
laxity, just come to the point at which she must either
retrace her steps into a stricter state, or go forward into a
formal latitudinarianism. Arnold was for the latter course;
the writers of the <cite>Tracts for the Times</cite> for the former. The
two schools met at these cross-roads, as it were, and a
remarkable contrast indeed they presented. The foremost
characters in the Church Movement (if they will excuse us
<!--315.png--><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a><span class="pageno">279</span>
looking at them so historically) were undoubtedly phenomena
in their way, as Arnold was in his. Of one of these we can
speak: the death that robs us of so much, gives us, at any
rate, this privilege. Singular it is that antagonist systems should
so suit themselves with champions; but if the world had been
picked for the most fair, adequate, and expressive specimens of
German-religionism and Catholicism (specimens that each side
would have acknowledged), it could not well have produced
better ones for the purpose than Dr. Arnold and Mr. Froude.
Arnold, gushing with the richness of domestic life, the darling
of Nature, and overflowing receptacle and enjoyer, with strong
healthy gusto, of all her endearments and sweets,&mdash;Arnold,
the representative of high joyous Lutheranism, is describable:
Mr. Froude, hardly. His intercourse with earth and Nature
seemed to cut through them like uncongenial steel, rather than
mix and mingle with them. Yet the polished blade smiled
as it went through. The grace and spirit with which he
adorned this outward world (and seemed, to an undiscerning
eye, to love it), were but something analogous in him to the
easy tone of men in high life, whose good-nature to inferiors is
the result either of their disinterested benevolence, or sublime
unconcern. In him, the severe sweetness of the life divine not
so much rejected as disarmed those potent glows and attractions
of the life natural: a high good temper civilly evaded and
disowned them. The monk by nature, the born aristocrat of
the Christian sphere, passed them clean by with inimitable
ease, marked his line, and shot clear beyond them into the
serene ether, toward the far-off Light, toward that needle’s
point on which ten thousand angels and all Heaven move….
The Catholic system, as it advanced from the worlds beyond
the grave, came with some of the colour and circumstance of
its origin. It contrasted strangely with the light, hearty,
and glowing form of earth that came from wood and mountain,
sunshine and green fields, to meet [it]. And the unearthly,
supernatural, dogmatic Church opposed a ghostly dignity to
the Church of Nature and the religion of the heart….</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘The notion of the Church being an independent body, and
able to keep her own succession going on, apart from the
<!--316.png--><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a><span class="pageno">280</span>
State, is [to Arnold] “all essentially anarchical and schismatic,”
and he is only defending, he says, “the common peace and
order of the Church, against a new outbreak of Puritanism,
to oppose it.” It appears a curious objection at first sight,
from a man like Arnold, to urge against a particular religion
the claim that it would have been considered treasonable in
the days of Queen Elizabeth. But this … is the period of
English History to which he always goes for his ecclesiastical
principles. Another point of accusation, more of a moral one,
does not come with peculiar grace from Arnold, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, the charge
of immodesty and impudence in personally daring to go so
counter to received opinions in their views of things and
persons. “I have read Froude’s volume,” he says, “and I
think that its predominant character is extraordinary impudence.
I never saw a more remarkable instance of that
qualification than the way in which he, a young man, and
a clergyman of the Church of England, reviles all those persons
whom the accordant voice of that Church, without distinction of
party, has agreed to honour, even perhaps with an excess of
admiration.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_317" id="fnanchor_317"></a><a href="#footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></span> Now, let it be ever so true that “the accordant
voice of the Church of England” has taken one view of
Cranmer and the Reformers, whereas Mr. Froude took another,
Arnold was not precisely the person to found a charge of
impudence upon such a fact. A man who without a vestige
of internal scruple or misgiving, unchristianised the whole
development of the Church from the days of the Apostles; who
made the very disciples, friends and successors of the Apostles
teachers of corruption; who made the priesthood an Antichrist,
and had just himself shocked the whole Church of
England by the promulgation of a religious theory repugnant
to the feeling and ideas of almost all her members to a man,&mdash;was
certainly not a person to be tender in requiring compliance
with received views from another, or quick to call
impudence in another what in himself was the necessary
adjunct of philosophy.’</p>

Churton</span>, Archdeacon of Cleveland. 2 <abbr title="volumes">vols.</abbr> Oxford:
J. H. Parker, 1861.</p>

<p class="center small">[By the kind permission of Messrs. J. Parker &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>]</p>

<p>‘… The first clear indication of this new principle [a theory
of Catholic union, to which all other considerations were to bow]
was seen in the publication of the <cite>Remains of R. H. Froude</cite>, a
young man of great promise, Fellow of Oriel College, who died at
the early age of thirty-two, and of whose stray papers, letters,
and remnants of conversation, a full collection was published by
J. H. Newman, then a Fellow of the same College, now for
some years past a member of the Society of the Oratory in
the Church of Rome. The first two volumes of these <cite>Remains</cite>
were published early in 1838. The work never obtained a
wide circulation; but enough was done to give deep offence
to many minds, and to unsettle the principles of many more.</p>

<p>‘Those who know Richard Froude best knew that he was
in the habit of expressing himself, both by writing and in
conversation, in strong, pungent sentences, such as are not
altogether uncommon with young men of brilliant minds and
vivacious temperament, and are often used by them as much with
the design of provoking answer and contradiction, as that of
conveying the speaker’s real sentiments. But when the Editor,
in his Preface to an unlimited and indiscriminate accumulation
of such winged words, claimed for them the consideration due
to the deliberate opinions of a matured reason, it was a mode
of treatment which stamped them with an importance not
properly their own, and justified the censure of those who
without concerning themselves much for the reputation of the
dead, or making allowance for what was with too little
decorum brought before the public, saw the publication
announcing itself as an expansion of the principles of the
<cite>Tracts</cite>. And this claim was made, although poor Froude
again and again declared himself, in the pages of these volumes,
as one whose mind was in a state of progress and puzzle,
sympathising at one time with Roman, at another with Puritan,
till, in a lengthened illness, and absence in foreign lands, it
<!--318.png--><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a><span class="pageno">282</span>
fed upon its own solitary musings, with that morbid dissatisfaction
at all things which sometimes accompanies the
decay of vital power. However, the appearance of such an
unreserved exposition of distracted fancies was a great
discouragement to the hopes which had for a while found their
centre at Oxford; and the disease of Richard Froude’s mind
seemed to have communicated itself to his more distinguished
Editor.’</p>
</div>

<p>‘… The scheme which Newman proposed, to restore to the
Anglican Church in some measure the discipline and doctrine
of the Fathers, was bold and captivating to [Mr. Ward’s]
imagination; but it seemed to [him] to be bolder and more
drastic in the change it must in consistency require, than its
authors were aware. It was plain to him that nothing short
of an explicit avowal that the principles of the Reformation
were to be disowned, and its work undone, could meet the
logical requirements of the situation. And the leaders
hesitated to go thus far…. On the appearance of the first
part of Froude’s <cite>Remains</cite> early in 1838, in which the Reformation
was avowedly condemned, and its condemnation tacitly<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_318" id="fnanchor_318"></a><a href="#footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></span>
adopted by the two Editors, Newman and Keble, Mr. Ward
acknowledged to himself the direction which his views were
taking. “From that time,” he wrote to Dr. Pusey, “began my
inclination to see Truth where I trust it is.” The final
influence which determined his conversion was the series of
lectures by Newman on The Scripture Proof of the Doctrines
of the Church, published afterwards as Tract 85. Newman,
in these lectures, dealt with the philosophical basis of
latitudinarianism on the one hand, and of the Anglo-Catholic
view of the Church on the other, with a power which did not
<!--319.png--><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a><span class="pageno">283</span>
fail to give satisfaction to his new disciple, and to justify, on
intellectual grounds, the position which was now invested, in
Ward’s mind, with all the charm of Froude’s romantic
conception of Catholic sanctity, the fire of his reforming genius,
the unhesitating completeness of his programme of action….
Dean Scott (the late Dean of Rochester), who saw Mr. Ward
daily in the Common Room at Balliol, notes some points of
interest as to the impression produced on his friends by the
change which Froude’s <cite>Remains</cite> wrought in his attitude:&mdash;“I
can speak with perfect assurance of their purport [the
purport of Mr. Ward’s remarks on the volumes published in
1838]. They were substantially these: ‘This is what I have
been looking for. Here is a man who knows what he means,
and says it. This is the man for me! He speaks out.’ But
though we were amused, and gave him credit for having
achieved the feat which the pseudo-scholastic doctor ascribes
to the angels, of passing from one extreme to the other without
passing through the middle, I do not really think that those
words indicated the actual turning-point. As I look back on
them, they seem to me to imply that the turn had taken place,
but that he was looking for a pledge, on the part of those to
whom he was attaching himself, that they were in earnest,
and knew what they meant.” The appearance of Froude’s
<cite>Remains</cite> was indeed an epoch in Mr. Ward’s life. “The thing
that was utterly abhorrent with him,” writes Lord Blachford,
“was to stop short”; and this was precisely what the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">via
media</i>, with all its attractiveness, had hitherto appeared to do.
All this was changed when Froude’s outspoken views were
adopted by the leaders. “Out came <em>Froude</em>,” writes Mr.
Ward to Dr. Pusey, “of which it is little to say that it
delighted me more than any book of the kind I ever read.”
“He found in Froude’s <cite>Remains</cite>,” continues Lord Blachford,
“a good deal of his own Radicalism (though nothing at all of
his own Utilitarianism or Liberalism), and it seemed literally
to make him jump for joy.”</p>

<p>‘… There was a good deal in Froude’s open speech and
direct intellect which resembled Mr. Ward’s own characteristics,
different as the two men were, in many respects. Newman
describes him as “brimful and overflowing with ideas and
<!--320.png--><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a><span class="pageno">284</span>
views”; as having “an intellect as critical and logical as it was
speculative and bold”; as “professing openly his admiration for
Rome, and his hatred of the Reformers”; as “delighting to think
of the Saints,” “having a vivid appreciation of the idea of
sanctity, its possibilities and its heights”; “embracing the
principle of penance and mortification”; “being powerfully
drawn to the Mediæval Church, but not to the Primitive.”
All this might be said, with great truth, of Mr. Ward himself.
The boldness and completeness, the uncompromising tone of
the <cite>Remains</cite>, took hold of Mr. Ward’s imagination. A clear,
explicit rule of faith was thus substituted for perplexing and
harassing speculation. There was no temporising, or stopping
short. Mr. Ward’s dislike of the current system was echoed
in the plain statement which he was for ever quoting. “At
length, under Henry <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr></span>, the Church of England fell. Will
she ever rise again?”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_319" id="fnanchor_319"></a><a href="#footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></span> Froude’s writing, then, recommended
itself to Mr. Ward as having the attribute of Lord Strafford’s
Irish policy: it was thorough. And in opposition to this,
Arnold’s system stopped short at every turn. Froude’s
picture of the Mediæval Church was that of an absolute, independent,
spiritual authority, direct, uncompromising, explicit
in its decrees, in contrast with the uncertain voice of the
English Church, with its hundred shades of opinions differing
from, and even opposed to, each other. Instead of groping
with the feeble light of human reason amid texts of uncertain
signification, he interpreted Scripture by the aid of constant
tradition, and of the Church’s divine illumination. The stand
for moral goodness against vice and worldliness was witnessed
in the highest and most ideal types of sanctity in Church
history. The personal struggle of the ordinary Christian
against his evil inclinations was systematised and brought to
perfection in Catholic ascetic works. The doctrine of a supernatural
world and supernatural influences was not minimised,
as though one feared to tax human powers of belief: it was
put forth in the fullest and most fearless manner. Angels and
Saints, as ministers of supernatural help, were recognised; and
<!--321.png--><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a><span class="pageno">285</span>
their various offices in aiding and protecting us, and listening
to our prayers on all occasions, forced on the attention constantly
in the Catholic system. There was no mistiness, or
haze, or hesitation. All was clear, complete, definite, carried
out to its logical consequences….</p>

<p>‘Ward himself speaks in no doubtful terms of union with
Rome as the ideal vision which inspired him. “Restoration of
active communion with the Roman Church”, he writes to a
friend in 1841, “is the most enchanting earthly prospect on
which my imagination can dwell.” His remarks, too, on
Froude’s book (in a letter written in the same year to Dr.
Pusey) indicate the same line of sympathies. “The especial
charm in it to me,” he wrote, “was … his hatred of our
present system and of the Reformers, and his sympathy with
the rest of Christendom.” The love of Rome and of an
united Christendom, which marked the new school, was not
purely a love for ecclesiastical authority. This was indeed
one element, but there was another yet more influential
in many minds: admiration for the Saints of the Roman
Church, and for the saintly ideal, as realised especially in
the monastic life. We have already seen how this element
operated in Mr. Ward’s own history. Froude had struck the
note of sanctity as well as the note of authority. He had
raised an inspiring ideal on both heads; and behold, with
however much of practical corruption and superstition mixed
up with their practical exhibitions, these ideals were actually
reverenced, attempted, often realised! in the existing Roman
Church. The worthies of the English Church, even when
sharing the tender piety of George Herbert or Bishop Ken,
fell short of the heroic aims, the martial sanctity, gained by
warfare unceasing against world, flesh, and devil, which they
found exhibited in Roman hagiology. The glorying in the
Cross of Christ, which is the keynote to such lives as those of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ignatius of Loyola, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis Xavier, while it recalled
much in the life of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul, had no counterpart in
post-Reformation Anglicanism.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_320" id="fnanchor_320"></a><a href="#footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></span> The state of things which
<!--322.png--><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a><span class="pageno">286</span>
made this directly Romeward movement tolerable to any
considerable section of the English Church was, however,
sufficiently remarkable. The Anglicanism of the party must
have receded very considerably from the views of the early
<cite>Tracts</cite> before such a thing could be possible. Perhaps two
events were especially instrumental to such a preparation: the
first was the language used with respect to the English Reformers
by Newman and Keble, in the Preface to the second
part of Froude’s <cite>Remains</cite>, early in 1839. However guarded
and measured the expressions were, such language expressed a
definite view, with far-reaching consequences; and the extraordinary
weight attaching to Newman’s lightest utterances
gave the words additional significance. “The Editors,” one
passage ran, “by publishing [Mr. Froude’s] sentiments … so
unreservedly … indicated their own general acquiescence in
the opinion that the persons chiefly instrumental in [the Reformation],
were not, as a party, to be trusted on ecclesiastical and
theological questions, nor yet to be imitated in their practical
handling of the unspeakably awful matters with which they
were concerned.” Again, the differences between the Reformers
and the Fathers, both in doctrine and in moral
sentiment, were insisted on by the Editors. “You must choose
between the two lines,” they wrote; “they are not only diverging,
but contrary.” And certain questions as to the practical
Christian ideal are specified as instances: “Compare the
sayings and manner of the two schools on the subjects of
fasting, celibacy, religious vows, voluntary retirement and
contemplation, the memory of the Saints, rites and ceremonies
recommended by antiquity.” The conclusion which, though
unspoken here, was undeniable once it was suggested, the conclusion
“in these matters Rome has preserved what England has
lost; in these matters we may take Rome for our model if we
would return to antiquity,”&mdash;could not but gain a footing in
the minds of Newman’s disciples.’</p>

From ‘<span class="smcap">A Narrative of Events connected with the
Publication of The Tracts for the Times</span>,’ by
<span class="smcap">William Palmer</span>, Author of <cite>Origines Liturgicæ</cite>, etc.
Rivingtons, 1883. [From the Introduction.]</p>

<p>‘The publication of this work [<cite>Origines Liturgicæ</cite>] had the
effect of introducing the author to the acquaintance of some
of the leading spirits who afterwards exercised a decisive influence
on the foundation of the Oxford Movement of 1833,
usually called “Tractarian.” He had, in this work, vindicated
the Church of England on what are sometimes called High
Church principles, affirming the divine institution of the Church,
and its essential independence, in creed and jurisdiction, of
merely temporal powers. He had also argued against the
Nonjurors, and sustained the harmony of Church and State.
He had vindicated the Reformation. He had defended the
Catholicity and continuity of the Church in England, and had
opposed the pretensions of the See of Rome. No one
could mistake his principles, and these principles were felt by
the great mass of Churchmen to be in harmony with their own.
In forming the acquaintance of Newman and Froude, then
very distinguished Fellows of Oriel, and amongst rising men
in the University, the author knew that his principles, at least,
were fully known to, and approved by, these eminent men….</p>

<p>‘… The autumn and winter of 1832 passed away, but
early in 1833 Froude returned to Oxford in better health, and
I had once more a friend with whom I could work with entire
sympathy in Church questions. For never did I meet with a
more cordial response to all that I felt upon these matters, or
a fuller sympathy. The only point on which I could not
concur with him was the manner in which he spoke of the
union of Church and State, which he esteemed unlawful <i>per se</i>,
while I only objected to its abuses. His language as to the
Reformation, too, I could not concur in, having considered with
some attention the point as urged in Nonjuring works, and
arrived at the conclusion that the Reformation did not merit
the unfavourable judgment pronounced. After some months,
in July we were joined by Newman, who had been detained
by illness in France; and this greatly strengthened our hands.</p>

<p><!--324.png--><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a><span class="pageno">288</span>
‘In an article in the <cite>Contemporary Review</cite><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_321" id="fnanchor_321"></a><a href="#footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></span> on the Oxford
Movement, I have ventured on the remark that I was not
aware of an incident mentioned in Froude’s <cite>Remains</cite>, illustrative
at once of the absence of elementary knowledge of the
Roman Catholic system, and of the disposition to frame
ingenious hypotheses upon the most important practical subjects.
The incident referred to I described thus: “Froude had, with
Newman, been anxious to ascertain the terms upon which they
could be admitted to communion by the Roman Church,
supposing that some dispensation might be granted which
would enable them to communicate with Rome without
violation of conscience”; and I elsewhere remarked on Newman
[that] “those who conversed with him did not know that while
in Italy he had sought, in company with Froude, to ascertain
the terms on which they might be admitted to communion
with Rome, and had been surprised on learning that an acceptance
of the decrees of Trent was a necessary preliminary”; and
I added: “had I been aware of these circumstances, I do not
know whether I should have been able to co-operate cordially
with him.” Nay, if I had supposed him to be willing to forsake
the Church of England, I should have said that I could, in that
case, have held no communion with him. As to his knowledge of
the Roman Catholic system at that time, it was not grounded on
the critical examination of Roman Catholic works of controversy.
It was, I think, superficial, at that time and long after….</p>

<p>‘The passage on which my remarks were based was in
Froude’s <cite>Remains</cite>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 304, 307, in which he says: “The only
thing I can put my hand on as an acquisition [at Rome] is
having become acquainted with a man of some influence at
Rome, Monsignor [Wiseman], the head of the [English] College,
who has enlightened [Newman] and me on the subject of our
relations to the Church of Rome. We got introduced to him
to find out whether they would take us in on any terms to
which we could twist our consciences, and we found, to our
dismay, that not one step could be gained without swallowing
the Council of Trent as a whole.” Mr. Newman, in editing
this passage, in Froude’s <cite>Remains</cite>, represents it as merely “a
jesting way of stating to a friend what was really the fact: <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>,
<!--325.png--><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a><span class="pageno">289</span>
that he and another availed themselves of the opportunity of
meeting a learned Romanist to ascertain the ultimate points
at issue between the Churches.” Cardinal Newman insists upon
it that this is the true version of the affair. I merely ask the
reader to compare the two statements: that of Froude, made
at the time, and distinctly, and that of Newman, made some
years after, to explain it. I ask whether the explanation is
not throughout inconsistent with the statement, whether it is
not a plain attempt to explain away the statement of Froude,
whether Froude’s is not evidently the true version? No doubt
Newman thought such explanation quite within his province
as Editor. This little piece of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">finesse</i> merits no grave animadversion,
and I trust that I have so explained the point …
as to relieve me from the imputation of accusing of dishonesty
an old friend so much honoured for virtue and honour.’</p>

<p class="p2 center">[From the Narrative.]</p>

<p>‘I had not been very intimately acquainted with Mr.
Newman and Mr. Froude, and was scarcely known to Mr.
Keble, or Mr. Perceval, when our deep sense of the wrongs
sustained by the Church in the suppression of Bishoprics, and
our feeling of the necessity of doing whatever was in our
power to arrest the tide of evil, brought us together in the
summer of 1833. It was at the beginning of Long Vacation
when, Mr. Froude being almost the only occupant of Oriel
College, we frequently met in the Common Room, that the
resolution to unite and associate in defence of the Church, of
her violated liberties and neglected principles, arose. This resolution
was immediately acted on; and while I corresponded
with Mr. Rose, Mr. Froude communicated our design to Mr.
Keble. Mr. Newman soon took part in our deliberations, on
his return from the Continent. The particular course which we
were to adopt became the subject of much and anxious thought;
and as it was deemed advisable to confer with Mr. Rose on so
important a subject, Mr. Froude and myself, after some correspondence,
visited him at Hadleigh, in July; where I also had
the pleasure of becoming personally acquainted with Mr.
Perceval, who had been invited to take part in our deliberations….
On our return to Oxford, frequent conferences took place
<!--326.png--><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a><span class="pageno">290</span>
at Oriel College, between Mr. Froude, Mr. Newman, Mr. Keble,
and the writer, in which various plans were discussed…. I
prepared a draft of the third formulary printed by Mr.
Perceval, which was revised and improved by a friend, and
was finally adopted as a basis of our further proceedings.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_322" id="fnanchor_322"></a><a href="#footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></span> The
formulary thus agreed on was printed and was privately and
extensively circulated amongst our friends in all parts of
England, in the autumn of 1833. Our intention was not
to form a society merely at Oxford, but to extend it throughout
all England, or rather, to form similar societies in every
part of England. But finding that jealousy was expressed in
several high quarters at the formation of any associations, and
the notion being also unacceptable to Froude and others
(Newman), at Oxford, we ceased, after a time, from circulating
these papers, or advising the formation of societies. Some
permanent effects, however, were produced….</p>

<p>‘The publication of the <cite>Tracts</cite> commenced and was continued
by several of our friends,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_323" id="fnanchor_323"></a><a href="#footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></span> each writer printing whatever
appeared to him advisable or useful, without the formality of
previous consultation with others…. I confess that I was
rather surprised at the rapidity with which they were composed
and published, without any previous revision or consultation;
nor did it seem to me that any caution was exercised in avoiding
language calculated to give needless offence…. The
respect and regard due to the authors of the <cite>Tracts</cite> rendered
me anxious to place the most favourable construction on everything
which they wrote, and to hope that my apprehensions
might be ill-founded. In the course, however, of the extensive
correspondence of the autumn and winter of 1833 which has
been mentioned, so many objections were raised by the clergy
against parts of the <cite>Tracts</cite>, and so many indiscretions were
pointed out, that I became convinced of the necessity of making
some attempt to arrest the evil. With this object, I made
<!--327.png--><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a><span class="pageno">291</span>
application in a direction (Newman) where much influence in
the management of the <cite>Tracts</cite> was exercised, and very earnestly
urged the necessity of putting an end to their publication, or
at least of suspending them for a time. On one occasion, I
thought I had been successful in the former object, and stated
the fact to several correspondents; but the sequel proved that I
was mistaken.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_324" id="fnanchor_324"></a><a href="#footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></span> … Certainly, I had, in private conversation with
Mr. Froude, and one or two others, felt that there were material
differences between our views, on several important points. I
allude more particularly to the question of the union of Church
and State, and of the character of the English and the foreign
Reformers. Mr. Froude occasionally expressed sentiments on the
latter subject which seemed extremely unjust to the Reformers,
and injurious to the Church; but as his conversation generally was
of a very startling and paradoxical character, and his sentiments
were evidently only in the course of formation, I trusted that more
knowledge and thought would bring him to juster views….</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘I will not say that the writers of the <cite>Tracts</cite> have not been
in any degree instrumental in drawing forth this spirit;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_325" id="fnanchor_325"></a><a href="#footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></span> I will
not inquire how far it is traceable to the publication of Froude’s
<cite>Remains</cite>, and to the defence of his views contained in the Preface
to the second series of the <cite>Remains</cite>; nor will I examine how
far it may be a reaction against ultra-Protestantism: it is unnecessary
now to enter on this painful and complicated question,
on which different opinions may be entertained.’</p>

<p class="center small">[By the kind permission of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> James H. Rigg, <abbr title="Doctor of Divinity">D.D.</abbr>, and of Mr. Charles
H. Kelly.]</p>

<p>‘Newman’s principles as the active leader of the Oxford
Movement were imbibed from his intercourse with Keble and
<!--328.png--><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a><span class="pageno">292</span>
Hurrell Froude. Newman himself says expressly and emphatically
that Keble was the real father of the Oxford Movement,
and it was the influence of Froude which brought together Keble
and Newman. It was Froude who effected that blending and
focussing of the sympathies and aims of Keble, Newman, and
himself which furnished the first inspiration and impulse of the
Oxford Neo-Anglican Movement. Newman, that is to say,
though afterwards the leader, was first the disciple of Keble
and even of Froude, and Keble and Froude derived their
Anglican indoctrination and inspiration not assuredly from the
Evangelical Revival, which they were brought up to hate, and
did, both, sincerely hate through life, but from the High Church
school of the early years of the eighteenth century, of which
Dr. Routh was a living representative at Oxford for many years
after Keble obtained his Fellowship at Oriel…. Keble was
the tutor and the loving and sympathetic friend of the bitter
and contemptuous Froude, who “hated the Reformation,” and
reserved his utmost scorn and antipathy for “irreverent Dissenters.” …
His personal opinions were extreme, so extreme
as to lead him to admire the character of Froude, in spite of
his immodesty, his intolerance, and his puerile asceticism, because
there was in the young man such heartiness, such good
fellowship, such zeal, such talent; and all consecrated to the
cause of “Catholic” restoration and Christian progress, as he
understood it.</p>

<p>‘… The characters of [Newman and Keble] were not likely
to blend, except under the influence of some common solvent,
some medium of overpoweringly strong affinity with both,
through which characters so sharply contrasted might be
combined in sympathy and united in counsel…. Nor could
a fitter instrument have been found for bringing about the
union on this basis than Hurrell Froude. He was himself, in
several respects, as great a contrast to Keble in character as
even Newman. But then he had been Keble’s pupil, and he
remained his devoted and admiring friend…. Moreover,
though Newman in his <cite>Apologia</cite> speaks of Froude as “speculative,”
he was not metaphysically sceptical, and his speculations
appear to have been confined within theologically safe regions.
Froude, in fact, stood in fear of Newman’s speculative tendency;
<!--329.png--><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a><span class="pageno">293</span>
and in one place, whilst expressing his delight in his companionship,
expresses his doubt whether he is not more or less of a
“heretic.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_326" id="fnanchor_326"></a><a href="#footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></span> In no sense was Hurrell Froude doctrinally or
metaphysically speculative. He had seemingly, from the first,
bound himself to tradition. His affections went after antiquity,
but, in particular, he doted upon the Mediæval Church. His
“speculations” never led him towards the verge of unbelief.
Whilst his zeal was hot, and his mind active, his intellect
seemed to make good its safety by servility to traditional
dogma. If he mocked at the Reformers, he held fast by the
“Saints.” Furthermore, although such a zealot for traditional
Church authority, and so bold and hot against all Protestants
and Puritans, he was to his friends gentle, tender, playful,
pleasant, and most open-hearted. It is easy to see by what
ties such a man would be attached to Keble and to Newman.
The former regarded him somewhat as a mother regards a
high-spirited, spoilt, but frank, true-spoken and affectionate son.
She is proud of him, while she disapproves of some of his proceedings.
She reproves him, but gently, lovingly: too gently
by far. She views all his conduct with a partial eye; his very
faults seem to her but the exuberances of a noble spirit. It
must be remembered also that Froude’s animosities correspond
to Keble’s dislikes, and that his enthusiastic and
passionate admiration was bestowed in accordance with Keble’s
preferences. The tempers of the teacher and pupil were very
different, but their tastes and opinions were well agreed; and,
in fact, those of Froude had been formed by Keble. What
Keble instilled by gentle influence became in Froude a potent
and heady spirit. Keble, accordingly, forgave the violence of
his pupil, in part for the sake of his orthodoxy, and in part
because of his dutifulness and affection to him personally.
His excesses were but the excesses of a fine young nature on
behalf of what was good and right. “E’en his failings leaned
to virtue’s side.” While such were the ties which attached
Keble to Froude, Newman was drawn to him both by agreement
in theological and ecclesiastical opinions and tendencies,
and also by a strong natural affinity of disposition. No one
<!--330.png--><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a><span class="pageno">294</span>
can read Newman’s description of Froude and himself in the
<cite>Apologia</cite> without feeling that he and such a man as Froude
must have been most congenial companions. Both were,
intellectually, what he describes Froude as being: “critical and
logical,” “speculative and bold.” Newman, no less than
Froude, “delighted in the notion of an hierarchical system of
sacerdotal power, and of full ecclesiastical liberty.” “Hatred
of the Reformers,” “scorn” of Protestantism, are noted by
Newman as characteristics of Froude. And, as to himself, “I
became fierce,” “I was indignant,” “I despised every rival
system,” “I had a thorough contempt for the Evangelicals,”&mdash;such
expressions as these abound in his delineation of his own
character at this period of his life. It is no wonder, therefore,
that Froude and Newman clave to each other…. Froude
was the energetic and wilful partner of Newman in the new
enterprise: Froude, who with far less genius, far less personal
tact and persuasiveness, and no gift of public or pulpit
suasion, such as Newman possessed in a wonderful degree, was
a man of intense and resolute character, of great logical daring,
of unsparing pugnacity, of far-reaching ideas, whom Newman,
and, as we have seen, Keble also, greatly admired and even
loved, though he was loved by few besides. These two men,
Newman and Froude, were mutually complementary: together
they planned the first lines of the Tractarian Movement….
For his characteristic work at Oxford, Newman had been
prepared by the influence of Keble and Froude. To quote
Dean Church, “Keble had given the inspiration, Froude had
given the impetus; then Newman took up the work.” If Froude
had lived a few years longer, it cannot be doubted that he
would have gone over the imaginary line of division, and would
have found himself consciously and professedly at Rome.
Keble had neither logic nor courage to take him across the
line…. Newman, alone of the three, slowly and reluctantly,
but by force of sincere and overmastering convictions, followed
his principles out to the complete end.</p>

<p>‘… To the Movement, as a Movement, Keble seems to
have actively contributed no momentum whatever, although
his reputation (like Pusey’s later on) lent it a powerful sanction.
To Newman belongs all the merit or demerit of the Tractarian
<!--331.png--><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a><span class="pageno">295</span>
line of policy and action. Without him, the Movement would
never have taken form or gathered way. Froude was, very
early, a powerful and energetic colleague: indeed, without him,
Newman would not have been what he was, nor done what he
did…. The chief interest attaching to Froude is that being
what he was, he so powerfully influenced Newman, who said
of him in his <cite>Lectures on Anglicanism</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_327" id="fnanchor_327"></a><a href="#footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></span> that “he, if any, is the
author of the Movement altogether”: a saying hardly, however,
consistent with the statement already quoted from the <cite>Apologia</cite>
as to Keble’s relation to the Movement. Froude was a man
of much force of will, and superior natural gifts; he was handsome
and attractive, a bright and lively companion, a warm
and affectionate friend, a “good fellow,” but very free indeed of
his tongue. He was ignorant, self-conscious, and audacious;
as intense a hater as he was a warm friend; a bitter bigot, a
reckless revolutionist; one who delighted to speak evil of
dignitaries, and of departed worthies and heroes reverenced by
Protestant Christians at home and abroad. Church, who did
not know him, but took his estimate of him mainly from
Newman, makes a conspicuous figure of him, giving much
more space to him than to Pusey,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_328" id="fnanchor_328"></a><a href="#footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></span> more even than to Keble.
That this should be so, shows how deeply Church had drunk
into the spirit that prompted and inspired the Tractarians. Even
his friendly hand, however, cannot omit from his picture certain
features which, to an outsider who is not fascinated by the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">camaraderie</i> of the Tractarian clique … will be almost
sufficient, without further evidence, to warrant the phrase, “a
flippant railer,” in which Julius Hare (himself, assuredly, no
Evangelical bigot or narrow sectary) describes the man
whose <cite>Remains</cite> were edited and published by his two great
friends, that Anglican Churchmen might be led to admire the
zeal and devotion, and to drink into the spirit, of this young
hero of the new party. According to their view, his early
<!--332.png--><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a><span class="pageno">296</span>
death in the odour of sanctity (although of true Christian
saintliness in temper or spirit he seems to have had as little
tincture as any persecuting Spanish saint), left an aureole of
glory upon his memory.</p>

<p>‘Such was Froude’s hatred of Puritanism that, as may be
learnt from Dean Church, he was “blind to the grandeur of
Milton’s poetry.” Church speaks, himself, of his “fiery impetuosity,
and the frank daring of his disrespectful vocabulary.”
He quotes James Mozley as saying: “I would not set down
anything that Froude says for his deliberate opinion, for he
really hates the present state of things so excessively that any
change would be a relief to him.” He says that “Froude was
made for conflict, not to win disciples.” He admits his
ignorance. “He was,” he tells us, “a man strong in abstract
thought and imagination, who wanted adequate knowledge.”
He quotes from the <cite>Apologia</cite> Newman’s admission of two
noticeable deficiencies in Froude: “he had no turn for
theology”; “his power of entering into the minds of others
was not equal to his other gifts.” Such a power, we may note,
is very unlikely to belong to men of fierce and hasty arrogance
and self-confidence. It finds its natural home in company
with “the wisdom from above,” which is not only “pure,” but
“gentle and easy to be entreated,” the characteristics of a
saintliness of another sort than that of Froude. Dean Church
admits that the <cite>Remains</cite> contain phrases and sentiments and
epithets surprisingly at variance with conventional and popular
estimates: “as, for example, we may explain, when Froude
speaks of the illustrious Bishop Jewel, whom Hooker calls
‘the worthiest divine that Christendom hath bred for the space
of some hundreds of years,’ as ‘an irreverent Dissenter,’
Church adds that ‘friends were pained and disturbed,’ while
‘foes exulted,’ at such a disclosure of the spirit of the Movement.”
The apology he offers is that “if the off-hand sayings
of any man of force and wit and strong convictions were made
known to the world, they would, by themselves, have much the
same look of flippancy, injustice, impertinence, to those who
disagreed with the speaker or writer…. The friends who
published Froude’s <cite>Remains</cite> knew what he was; they knew
the place and proportion of the fierce and scornful passages;
<!--333.png--><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a><span class="pageno">297</span>
they knew that they did not go beyond the liberty and the
frank speaking, which most people give themselves in the
abandon and understood exaggeration of intimate correspondence
and talk.” To which the reply is obvious: if
the Editors (who were no other than Newman and Keble)
had disapproved of the tone and style of these <cite>Remains</cite>, as it
is evident that Dean Church himself, notwithstanding his
strong friendly bias, could not help disapproving of them, they
would either not have published them, or would at least have
suggested some such apology as that suggested by Dean
Church. But, in fact, they published them without any such
apology, and it cannot be seriously doubted that they rather
rejoiced in than condemned such gross improprieties. Further,
if this sort of writing is common in the intimate correspondence
of responsible clergymen, how is it that it is so hard, if it is at
all possible, to match the flippancy and insolence of these
<cite>Remains</cite> in any other correspondence or remains of men of
Christian culture and character, known to modern literature?
Dean Church, indeed, cannot but admit that “Froude was
often intemperate and unjust,” and that “his strong language
gave needless exasperation.” He endeavours, however, to
make one point in favour of the Movement, from the publication
of the <cite>Remains</cite>. Whether it was wise or not, he argues
that “it was not the act of cunning conspirators: it was the
act of men who were ready to show their hands and take the
consequences; it was the mistake of men confident in their
own straightforwardness.” I have no wish to revive against
the first leaders of the Movement, as represented by Froude
and the admirable Editors of his <cite>Remains</cite>, the charge of being
conspirators, though, as I have already stated, Froude himself
was the first to describe the Tractarian Movement as a “conspiracy.”
Certainly Froude, in the earlier stage of the Movement,
like Ward in its later stages, had little in him of the
conspirator’s subtlety or craft, whatever may be said as to
Newman. But an unbiassed historian would hardly describe
the act of publication as Dean Church does: he would rather
say that it was the act of men whose honesty may be admitted,
but who were sanguine partisans, men strongly biassed by their
sectarian temper, by their over-weening self-confidence….</p>

<p><!--334.png--><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a><span class="pageno">298</span>
‘But it was a strange little world, that world of Oxford, in
which Froude was regarded as a bright and leading character,
sixty years ago. It seems, as we look back upon it, to be very
much farther away than half a century, and to belong almost
to a different planetary sphere…. It was, in fact, a young
and ignorant, as well as bigoted circle, in which the idea of the
Oxford Movement first germinated…. It was a school-boyish
sort of clique, and in wildness, enthusiasm, ignorance of
the actual forces and the gathering movements of the world
outside, their projects and dreams remind us of schoolboy
plans and projects for moving the world and achieving fame
and greatness….</p>

<p>‘Schoolboys’ friendships are often intense and romantic.
Those of Newman and his circle were passionately deep
and warm, more like those of boys, in some respects, than of
men; perhaps still more like those of women who live aloof
from the world in the seclusion of mutual intimacy: intimacy
suffused with the fascinating but hectic brightness of a
sort of celibate consecration to each other, apart from any
thought of stronger or more authoritative human ties that
might some time interfere with their sacrament of friendship.
This <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">morbidezza</i> of moral complexion and temperament,
this more or less unnatural and unhealthy intensity of
friendship, was a marked feature in Newman’s relations with
those around him. There is no doubt a touching side to
this feature in the Tractarian Society of Oxford. Dean
Church speaks of “the affection which was characteristic of
those days.” … Of the mutually feminine attachment which
bound Newman and Froude together, there is no need to say
more…. The <cite>Apologia</cite> sets it forth all the more fully
because Froude was no longer living…. Newman’s
was a characteristically feminine nature: it was feminine
in the quickness and subtlety of his instincts, in affection
and the caprices of affection, in diplomatic tact and adroitness,
and in a gift of statement and grace of phrase
which find their analogies in the conversation, in the public
addresses, and not seldom in the written style, of gifted
women…. Hurrell Froude, his chosen and most congenial
friend, was more feminine still than Newman, feminine
<!--335.png--><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a><span class="pageno">299</span>
in his faults as well as in his gifts and his defects.
For sympathy and mutual intelligence the two were wonderfully
well assorted…. It was a saying of Charles Kingsley
… that all the Tractarian leaders were wanting in virility:
<i>i.e.</i>, not so much effeminate as naturally more woman-like
than masculine.’</p>

<p>‘The only one of these remarkable men who has
passed into the region of history<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_329" id="fnanchor_329"></a><a href="#footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></span> is he who, though the
youngest of the whole number in years, deserves to be commemorated
as the first who took a comprehensive view of
the bearings and character of the Movement. Mr. Froude
was a College contemporary of my own, and I enjoyed at one
time the privilege of constant intercourse and familiar acquaintance
with him. Those who have formed their impression of
him from his published <cite>Remains</cite> will scarcely, perhaps, be
prepared to hear how little there appeared, in his external
deportment, while he was at Oxford, of that remarkable
austerity of life which he is now known to have habitually
practised, even then. To a form of singular elegance, and a
countenance of that peculiar and highest kind of beauty which
flows from purity of heart and mind, he added manners the
most refined and engaging. That air of sunny cheerfulness
which is best expressed by the French word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">riant</i>, never
forsook him (at the time when I knew him best), and diffused
itself, as is its wont, over every circle in which he moved. I
have seen him in spheres so different as the Common-Rooms
of Oxford, and the after-dinner company of the high aristocratic
<!--336.png--><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a><span class="pageno">300</span>
society of the West of England; and I well remember
how he mingled even with the last in a way so easy, yet so
dignified, as at once to conciliate its sympathies and direct
its tone. He was one of those who seemed to have extracted
real good out of an English Public School education, while
unaffected by its manifold vices. Popular among his companions
for his skill in all athletic exercises, as well as for his
humility, forbearance, and indomitable good temper, he had
the rare gift of changing the course of dangerous conversation
without uncouth abruptness or unbecoming dictation; and he
almost seemed, as is recorded of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bernardine of Sienna, to
check, by his mere presence, the profane jibe, or unseemly
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">équivoque</i>. To his great intellectual powers his published
<cite>Remains</cite> bear abundant witness; nor do we, in fact, need any
other proof of them than the deference yielded to his opinions
by such men as those who have acknowledged him for their
example and their guide. Let it not be supposed that this
high panegyric is prompted by the partiality of friendship.
Although I enjoyed constant opportunities of intercourse with
Mr. Froude, and made his character a study, yet I have no
claim whatever to be considered his intimate friend. We were
not, indeed, at that time, in anything like complete religious
accord; and I remember his once saying to me, in words
which subsequent events made me regard as prophetic:
“My dear O., I believe you will come right some day; but
you are a long time about it.” Poor Hurrell Froude! May
it be allowed to one who was your competitor in more than
one academical contest, and your inferior in everything
(save in his happy possession of those religious privileges
which you were cut off too early to allow of your attaining),
to pay you, after many years, this feeble tribute of
gratitude and admiration! Never again will Anglicanism
produce such a disciple; never, till she is Catholic, will Oxford
boast of such a son.</p>

<p class="unindent">To adjust such a character with Catholic facts and Catholic
principles is no part of my present object. The reader who
takes an interest in this question will find it discussed in Dr.
Newman’s <cite>Lectures on Anglican Difficulties</cite>. For me it will be
sufficient to take leave of this gifted person in the well-known
words: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum talis sis, utinam noster esses!</i></p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘The estimate taken [of the Reformers and] of their work
by Mr. Froude, Mr. Keble, and Mr. Newman became sufficiently
manifest on the publication of Mr. Froude’s <cite>Remains</cite>,
with the remarks prefixed to them by the friends just mentioned.
Mr. Froude had described the English Reformers in
general, as “a set with whom he wished to have less and less
to do.” He declared his opinion that Bishop Jewel was no
better than “an irreverent Dissenter,” and expressed himself as
sceptical whether Latimer (of whom, as a “Martyr,” he did
not wish to speak disrespectfully) were not “something in the
Bulteel line.” Dr. Pusey was too humble and forbearing to
enter any kind of public protest against statements and views so
different from his own. But he was generally believed not to
go along with the tenour of these expressions, nor to approve,
otherwise than by passive acquiescence, of the publication of
those parts of the work in which they were contained….
[Living,] Mr. Froude’s frankness and attractive personal qualities
gained from the rising generation of Oxford a favourable hearing
for the (to them) original views, which he so ably and
dashingly inculcated…. No one can read Mr. Froude’s
<cite>Remains</cite> … without seeing that with him and with those
with whom he corresponded, the ethical system of Oxford had
exercised no small influence in the formation of mental habits.
Those who, like myself, were personally acquainted with Mr.
<!--338.png--><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a><span class="pageno">302</span>
Froude, will remember how constantly he used to appeal to [the]
great moral teacher of antiquity, “Old ‘Stotle,” as he used playfully
to call him, against the shallow principles of the day. There
is a sense, I am convinced, in which the literature of heathenism
is often more religious than that of Protestantism. Thus, then,
it was that the philosophical studies of Oxford tended to form
certain great minds on a semi-Catholic type.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘Towards the close of his mortal career, his opinions appear
to have undergone some change which was perceptible to
many of his friends even in his outward demeanour. He
associated less than formerly with the old High Church party
of the Establishment, as he became convinced that the ills of
the Church must be cured by sterner and more unworldly
methods of discipline than that party was prepared to accept.
An air of gravity, and a tone of severity, even in general
society (so far as he mixed with it), had replaced that bright
and sunny cheerfulness which was characteristic of his earlier
days; and this change of exterior was greater than could be
explained by his declining health, against which he bore up
with exemplary fortitude. Together with a more anxious
view of the state and prospects of the Establishment, he had
apparently taken up a less favourable opinion of the Catholic
Church, at least in its actual manifestation. A visit to the
Continent had operated (from whatever cause) unfavourably
upon his judgment of Catholics, whom he now first stigmatised
as “Tridentines”: a strange commentary, certainly, on the view
put forth later by Mr. Newman, to the effect that the prevalent
Catholic system was erroneous in that it had deviated from
the Tridentine rule, not in that it represented that rule! This
and similar dicta, some of a still more painful import, have led
such of Mr. Froude’s friends as have clung to the Established
Church to believe that, had he lived, he would have remained
on their side. Such a question will naturally be determined,
to a great extent, according to the personal views and wishes
of those who speculate upon it. Certain at any rate it is, that
had he come to us, the Church would have secured the humble
obedience and faithful service of a rarely gifted intellect; while,
had he stayed behind, he would have added one more to the
<!--339.png--><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a><span class="pageno">303</span>
number of those whose absence is the theme of our lamentation,
and whose conversion, the object of our prayers. It is
part, however, of the historian’s office to investigate such
questions according to the evidence at his disposal; and in the
instance before us, that evidence is far more accessible and far
more satisfactory than is usually the case in posthumous
inquiries. Mr. Froude’s Letters to Friends, published in his
<cite>Remains</cite>, give an insight into his character and feelings, with
all their various developments and vicissitudes, such as is
commonly the privilege of intimate personal acquaintance, and
of that alone. His bosom friends could hardly have known
him better than the careful student of these Letters may know
him, if he desire it: indeed, it is to such friends that he discloses
himself in those Letters with almost the plain-spokenness of the
Confessional.</p>

<p>‘Now, it must be admitted that these Letters leave the
question as to the probability of his conversion very much in that
evenly-balanced state in which, as I have just said, the wishes
of friends or partisans come in to determine it on either side.
His Letters contain, on the one hand, many passages from
which, if they stood alone, it might be concluded that he was,
at certain times, almost ripe for conversion. They also contain
others apparently of an opposite tenour. In the former class
must be reckoned those indications of antipathy, continually
deriving fresh fuel from new researches, to the English Reformation
and Reformers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_330" id="fnanchor_330"></a><a href="#footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></span> Mr. Froude’s theological sentiments
had long passed the mark of the Laudian era, and settled at
the point of the Nonjurors.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_331" id="fnanchor_331"></a><a href="#footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></span> He thinks one might take for an
example Francis de Sales, whom, by the way, he classes with
“Jansenist Saints.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_332" id="fnanchor_332"></a><a href="#footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></span> Again, he was most deeply sensitive to
the shortcomings and anomalies of his communion: he calls
it an “incubus” on the country, and ascribes to it the blighting
properties of the “upas-tree.” It is evident that he was in
advance both of Mr. Keble and Mr. Newman: he twits the
former, in friendly expostulation, with the Protestantism of his
phraseology in parts of <cite>The Christian Year</cite>, and laments the
backwardness of the latter on some questions of the day. On
<!--340.png--><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a><span class="pageno">304</span>
the other hand, and in the same direction of thought, he
expresses admiration of Cardinal Pole; he scruples about
speaking against the Catholic system, even its “seemingly
indifferent practices”;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_333" id="fnanchor_333"></a><a href="#footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></span> he can understand, on the principle of
reverence, the Communion under one species,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_334" id="fnanchor_334"></a><a href="#footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></span> perhaps the
greatest of all practical difficulties to many Anglican minds.
Moreover, when at Rome, he evidently opened the subject of
reconciliation to a distinguished prelate whom he met there.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_335" id="fnanchor_335"></a><a href="#footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Per contra</i>, we have painful sayings against supposed practical
abuses in the Church. “He really thought,” as he tells us, that
“certain practices which he witnessed abroad are idolatrous”;
he charges priests with irreverence, ecclesiastical authorities
with laxity, etc.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_336" id="fnanchor_336"></a><a href="#footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></span> Yet even these opinions he partially qualifies,
and is disposed to attribute to defective information.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_337" id="fnanchor_337"></a><a href="#footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></span> He
shrinks from speaking against Rome <em>as a Church</em>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_338" id="fnanchor_338"></a><a href="#footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Unwilling as I am to hazard conjectures on the subject,
especially against the judgement of any among his more intimate
friends, I do not think it unreasonable to conclude, from
a comparison of these passages, that Mr. Froude’s objections
were chiefly directed against imaginary abuses, or possible
relaxations of discipline, which time and reflection would have
shown him to be entirely independent of the real merits of the
controversy. I find it also difficult to believe that, as the
principle of the English Reformation received these illustrations
in the Established Church which we have lived long enough to
see,&mdash;as her constituted tribunals were found to give up, in
succession, the grace of the Sacraments, the authority of the
Church, and even the inspiration of Holy Scripture itself, as
necessary truths,&mdash;his clear and honest mind would not have
accepted some or all of these tokens of apostasy as a summons
to enter the True Fold. Assuredly, too, we have known no instance
of a mind equally candid, intelligent, and instructed, whose
advances in the direction of the Truth (especially when assisted
by extraordinary acuteness of conscience and purity of life)
<!--341.png--><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a><span class="pageno">305</span>
have stopped short, as time has gone on, of the logical conclusions,
except in cases where the progress of such a mind has
been arrested by conflicting tendencies of deeply ingrained
Protestant or national prepossession: such as in his case were
singularly absent.</p>

<p>‘There is, however, one phase of Mr. Froude’s mind with
which it is far more difficult to reconcile the belief of his
probable conversion than any other. This phase, indeed,
seems to have been a characteristic of himself as compared
with nearly all of those who took a leading part in the Movement,
including even Mr. Keble, who was the nearest to Mr.
Froude in general character. The peculiarity to which I
refer is that of an extraordinary leaning to the side of religious
dread, and a correspondent suppression of the sentiments of
love and joy. Mr. Froude’s religion, as far as it can be
gathered from his published Journal, seems to have been (if the
expression be not too strong) more like that of a humble and
pious Jew under the Old Dispensation, than that of a Christian
living in the full sunshine of Gospel privileges. The apology
for this feature in his religious character, and for any portion
of it which appears in those of other excellent men of the same
period,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_339" id="fnanchor_339"></a><a href="#footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></span> is to be found in the ungraceful and often irreverent
form in which the warmer side of the Christian temper was
exhibited in the party called Evangelical: whose language,
based as it often was upon grievous errors of doctrine, had a
tendency to react, in religious minds, on the side of severity
and reserve. Such a form of religious spirit, however, where
exhibited in the somewhat unusual proportions which it
assumes in Mr. Froude, must undergo almost a complete
revolution before it can be naturally susceptible of the
impression which Catholic devotion has a tendency to produce,
or even tolerant of the language which pervades our
approved Manuals. It is certainly difficult to find in the Mr.
Froude of the <cite>Remains</cite>, a compartment for devotion to Our
<!--342.png--><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a><span class="pageno">306</span>
Blessed Lady,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_340" id="fnanchor_340"></a><a href="#footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></span> for instance, or even to the Sacred Humanity
of Our Lord, in all its attractive and endearing fulness.
Yet, taking the phenomena of his case as a whole, and
duly estimating the respective powers of the two conflicting
forces, I cannot help thinking that the Church would more
easily have conquered his prejudices than the Establishment
have retained his allegiance.’</p>

<p>‘… The first volume of this book, to which the following
observations will be confined, presents an unusually perfect
history of as remarkable a mind as it is often our lot to fall
in with. It is remarkable, not merely for its talent, energy,
and depth of religious feeling, but because the character in
which these qualities issue, is one almost new to the eyes of
this generation; and with this unusual tone of thought and
feeling, is joined a deep reality and consistency which forces
attention, and perhaps deference, even when the author’s views
least coincide with our own settled prejudices….</p>

<p>‘… There is a wide intermediate range of character
among those who neither neglect nor rest in their fellow-men.
With some, those feelings of reverence and admiration, which
seem like the voice of God assigning to every man his province,
are more deeply touched by the quiet holiness of domestic life,
its little delicate self-sacrifices, its affectionate attentions and
glad confidence. The idol of their hearts is one whom men
love even when he is most severe, or, if they love him not
they dare not avow it, knowing that the world would hold them
self-condemned; whose enjoyment it is to confer enjoyment,
who moves about with a heart and sympathies open to all
he meets, expecting no evil; and, when encountered by vice,
<!--343.png--><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a><span class="pageno">307</span>
rebukes it with a mixture of horror, pity, and simplicity, which,
if they fail to convince, at least never irritate or harden. Not
that such an one need be wanting in the expression of just
indignation, but he shows no intention to punish, no assumption
of superiority. He speaks either by way of affectionate
remonstrance, or to disburden his own conscience; and those
who are too bad to be affected by mere goodness, only say of
him “that he is as kind-hearted a man as can be; pity he
should let his fancies run away with him.”</p>

<p>‘It need hardly be said that this is Christian love, but
not its only form. Minds more bitterly alive to the unsatisfying
nature of earthly things, will thirst after some more
immediate form of self-devotion to God: and the same feelings
which render their brethren less adequate representatives of
their Heavenly Father in their hearts, imply capacities which
render them less necessary. They will press as close to God
as He will let them, anxious, if it were possible, to anticipate
His purposes concerning them, watching for permission to
throw away earthly comforts in His service, if He will give
them the signal to take to themselves that honour; laborious,
by meditation and mortification of the flesh, to root out from their
hearts every idle desire that interferes with His presence there,
and to bend to His direct service every high taste and faculty
which He has given them: who would sing songs to His glory
though there were none to hear them, and would adorn holy
places though there were none to see them; anxious for no
result, but for the mere happiness of devoting heart, head, and
hand to His honour, if they have but an instinct or a word of
His to tell them that He will be pleased with their little offering.
These men will no more forget their brethren than the
others will forget God; they will have their words of encouragement
for the penitent, of courtesy for the stranger, of deep
affection for their friends. But they do not go about, overflowing
with kindness and confidence to all men. Perhaps circumstances
have thrown upon them one of those great works which
ever lie about the world unappropriated, and they are
“straitened till it be accomplished.” Perhaps the work of
their own salvation lies heavier on their spirits than on theirs
who live and die in happy, quiet, uniform thankfulness.
<!--344.png--><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a><span class="pageno">308</span>
Perhaps their own renunciation of the lesser pleasures of life
makes them less understand the value which others set on
them. At any rate, their constant endeavour to realise within
themselves their own high aspirations, tends to unfit them for
sympathising with buoyant earthly merriment, or sanguine
earthly wishes, except it be with the passing interest which we
give to the careless gaiety of a child.</p>

<p>‘Again, the stern examination by which they purge their
own hearts, that they may be worthy of God, opens to them
the secrets of others. It shows them what is their own meanness
in the sight of God, and what it may be in the sight of
their fellow-men; but it lays upon them the painful power of
seeing through profession and self-deceit, and it teaches them
how, by word and eye, to silence and chastise as well as protest.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘These men, it need scarcely be said, are not talked of as
“kind-hearted fellows”; they are felt to be partisans, and are
reverenced or hated accordingly. Their presence, when it
does not deepen the interest of conversation, is apt to impose
a check on its freedom. Men are afraid of being frivolous and
unreal in their presence; doubtful what will offend them; or
what degree of forbearance they may reckon on; suspicious of
their motives, as of men who do not speak freely, unless they
speak with authority, of what they most deeply mean; and
cautious in accepting their friendship, for it is only firmly
given to similarity of religious aim. But the loftiness of
sentiment which confines, deepens also the flow of their
sympathies; their power of severity gives meaning to their
affection, and their singleness of aim a high harmony to their
thoughts and tastes. Those who will take their hand and
walk with them will find the fruit of their friendship rich
according to its noble origin and tenure.</p>

<p>‘Now of these two characters it would perhaps be overbold
to say which is holiest; at any rate, the loveliness of one is very
different from the majesty of the other: different, not indeed
in essentials, but in the hopes, fears, tastes, and sentiments,
which it forces uppermost…. The later Church of England
character is very decidedly of the former cast. Ours is the
Church of Walton and Herbert, not of Athanasius and
<!--345.png--><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a><span class="pageno">309</span>
Ambrose. And truly we have been born into a beautiful
inheritance. Our fathers have bequeathed to us the appreciation
of a kindly and a holy spirit; a spirit of affectionate
unobtrusive meekness, of considerate friendliness, of calm
cheerfulness. And these are in their measure not only
appreciated but realised amongst us: the domestic and social
virtues of our clergy are in the mouths of every panegyrist of
the Church of England, and are hardly denied by her enemies….
And it is true, that there are passages of Scripture which
address themselves to a very different class of minds: passages
which <ins title="ho dynamenos chôrein chôreitô">ὁ δυνάμενος χωρεῖν, χωρείτω</ins>, which “all men cannot
receive, but they to whom it is given.” There are a whole
class of expressions in the New Testament, which though
surely they do not condemn the English Church, yet seem
somehow not to have received their natural development in
it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_342" id="fnanchor_342"></a><a href="#footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></span> “If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast …
and come, follow Me.” “Blessed are ye when men shall hate
you.” “Woe unto you that laugh now, for ye shall mourn and
weep.” “<ins title="Kalon anthrôpô gynaikos mê haptesthai">Κάλον ἀνθρώπῳ γύναικος μὴ ἅπτεσθαι</ins>.” “Every one
that hath forsaken brethren or sisters, or father or mother, or
wife or children, for My Name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold,
and shall inherit everlasting life.” We seem afraid of these.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘Within our own Church, we are over-careful to soothe
enthusiasm, and somewhat helpless in directing it. In judging
foreign Churches, or other ages, we talk of a “misguided zeal
for what they consider the glory of God,” “the fantastic rigours
by which men render themselves callous to the sufferings of
others,” “the extinction of the domestic affections to aggrandise
one ambitious Church,” words which may be true or not, as
they are applied, but which, as commonly used, are rather
rashly bandied about, considering all the hints and recommendations
that Scripture contains.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_343" id="fnanchor_343"></a><a href="#footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></span> We can be warm enough in
<!--346.png--><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a><span class="pageno">310</span>
our censures of those who would call down fire from Heaven,
or sit at the right hand of Christ, but have perhaps too much
fellow-feeling with him who went away sorrowful when he
found he must not only obey the law, but sell his property.
The book now before us is, most unquestionably, not of the
peculiar Church of England character, but of that cast which
we are somewhat apt to depreciate, or to look on as a romantic
unreality….</p>

<p>‘In his Private Journal, which was written chiefly in 1826,
when he was about twenty-four, the feeling round which all
others seem to group themselves, is a craving after an ideal
happiness, real and attainable, though not yet, of which all
our refined perceptions of beauty, nobility, and holiness are
but indications and foretastes, and in which, as our character
becomes equal to our capacities, they must eventually converge.
With this is joined, as perhaps its necessary condition,
a sensitive and pure taste for all that is beautiful or lofty to
sight or mind; high, though unpractised, poetical powers; and
an earnest appreciation of the reverence due to holy things,
even to our own higher thoughts and deeper emotions.</p>

<p>‘This itself explains why these powers and feelings, lying,
it seems, deepest, were unknown, almost unsuspected, by more
than two or three of his nearest friends. His acquaintance
more readily perceived and appreciated an unusually deep and
true mode of dealing with mathematical questions; a subtlety,
boldness and ingenuity of reasoning; a frank and accurate
apprehension of the full force of an adverse argument; and a
definiteness of conception and expression which seemed to cut
through an intricate question, throwing off, rather than
grappling with objections, with a clearness which one could
hardly believe not to be sophistry.</p>

<p><!--347.png--><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a><span class="pageno">311</span>
‘But this book derives its commanding interest from the stern
self-chastisement of body and mind, from which both reason
and imagination receive their tone and substance. With this
the Journal acquaints us; and there is something which really
cows an ordinary reader, in the unsparing steadiness with which
faults are sought for, the bitter self-abasement with which they
are felt, and the unrelenting determination with which they are
punished; all being recorded, except when addressed to God,
with a plain and sometimes contemptuous homeliness of expression,
which seems as if the author wished to do dishonour
to himself and his thoughts, or held that a feeling which
claimed to be deep and true, should not disdain to buy, by
humiliation, the privilege of utterance….</p>

<p>‘… In 1825, in which year he took his degree,
passages in his letters show the existence of those
romantic views of religion which occupy so prominent a
place in his character from that time forward. Of part of
the intervening time, he speaks often in his Journal with
very deep contrition: but anyone who observes the deep
humiliation with which he confesses faults of which ordinary
persons would think but little, (common indeed to all who
have really high views of Christian excellence,) will be very
cautious in inferring much as to the facts themselves, from this
most bitter recollection of them. The Journal itself may
perhaps be best introduced by some letters, giving an account
of the first part of the time which it records.’</p>

<p>‘“I have been meaning to write to you every day for a long
time, and I do not suppose you would wish me to be influenced
in putting off longer by the sad thing we have just heard.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_344" id="fnanchor_344"></a><a href="#footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></span>
At least, if I may judge from myself, there is so little
difference between what are called real afflictions and
imaginary ones, that it seems just as rational to go on in the
common way when under the former as the latter. With me,
this last summer, both at the time, and looking back on it,
<!--348.png--><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a><span class="pageno">312</span>
seems to have gone very strangely; and I do not see any
ground why my reason should contradict my feelings, because
the things which affect me are either, in their nature, confined
to the person who feels them, or are thought trifles by people
in general. I have been trying almost all the Long [Vacation]
to discover a sort of common-sense romance: I am convinced
there must be such a thing, and that Nature did not give us
such a high capacity for pleasure without making some other
qualification for it besides delusion. But the speculation has
got much more serious, and runs out into many more ramifications
than I expected at first; and it seems to me as if I
might make it the main object of a long course of reading, the
first step of which would be to follow your advice in learning
Hebrew and reading the early Fathers. This I have determined
upon doing immediately upon my return to Oxford;
and the intervening space I shall pass away as I can, with I.
and P.,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_345" id="fnanchor_345"></a><a href="#footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></span> among the mountains and waterfalls. Since I wrote
this in the morning, I have been walking with P., whose
quietness of mind makes me quite ashamed of my speculations,
and I hardly like sending you this letter; however, if I have
been making myself a fool all the summer, it is better I should
not go on brooding on it by myself; for letting somebody
know the state of my thoughts is the only way of keeping
them straight; and I know no one but you who would make
sufficient allowance for me to venture on such things with.
Perhaps you may think it very odd, but this is the first time
I have had resolution to ask for the papers which they found
of my mother’s after her death.”</p>

<p class="p2">‘The writer seems to have shrunk from allowing this letter
to reach his friend. In its stead, the following was sent:</p>

<p>‘“I have made three attempts to write, but all of them ran
off into something wild, which, upon reflection, I thought
would be better kept to myself. The fact is, that I have been
in a strange way all the summer, and having had no one to
talk to about the things which have bothered me, I have been
every now and then getting into fits of enthusiasm or despondency.
But the result has been in some respects a good
<!--349.png--><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a><span class="pageno">313</span>
one, and I have got to take very great pleasure in what you
recommended me when we were together at F.,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_346" id="fnanchor_346"></a><a href="#footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></span> the evening
before I left you, our first summer, <i>i.e.</i> good books; and I feel
[I] understand places in the Psalms in a way I never used to.
I go back to Oxford with a determination to set to at Hebrew
and the early Fathers, and to keep myself in as strict order as
I can: a thing which I have been making ineffectual attempts
at for some time, but which never once entered my head for a
long time of my life….</p>

<p>‘“And now I must drop back to myself. I wish you would
say anything to me that you think would do me good, however
severe it may be. You must have observed many things very
contemptible in me, but I know worse of myself, and shall be
prepared for anything. I cannot help being afraid that I am
still deceiving myself about my motives and feelings, and shall
be glad of anything on which to steady myself.”</p>

<p>‘It is exceedingly interesting to trace in the Journal the
actual working day by day of the feelings to which these
letters refer. The following extract is, in effect, its opening:</p>

<p>‘“<span class="date">July 1, 1826.</span>&mdash;I think it will be a better way to keep a
Journal for a bit, as I find I want keeping in order about more
things than reading. I am in a most conceited way, besides
very ill-tempered and irritable. My thoughts wander very
much at my prayers, and I feel hungry for some ideal thing of
which I have no definite idea. I sometimes fancy that the
odd bothering feeling which gets possession of me is affectation,
and that I appropriate it because I think it a sign of genius:
but it lasts too long, and is too disagreeable to be unreal.”</p>

<p>‘“<span class="date">July 5.</span>&mdash;I do not know how it is, but it seems to me as
if the consciousness of having capacities for happiness, with no
objects to gratify them, seems to grow upon me, and puts me
in a dreary way. Lord, have mercy upon me!”</p>

<p>‘These feelings continue occasionally to appear, assuming,
more and more, a distinct and practical shape, till his return
to Oxford in October, 1826 (the period when the Letters before
quoted were written), when they gave rise to the following
resolutions:</p>

<p>‘“I have been coming to a resolution, that as soon as I am
<!--350.png--><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a><span class="pageno">314</span>
out of the reach of observation, I will begin a sort of monastic
austere life, and do my best to chastise myself before the
Lord; that I will attend Chapel regularly; eat little and
plainly, drink as little wine as I can, consistently with the
forms of society; keep the fasts of the Church, as much as I
can, without ostentation; continue to get up at six in the
winter; abstain from all unnecessary expenses, in everything;
give all the money I can save in charity, or for the adorning
of religion. That I will submit myself to the wishes of the
[Provost?] as to one set over me by the Lord, but never give in
to the will or opinion of anyone from idleness, or false shame,
or want of spirit. That I will avoid society as much as I can,
except those I can do good to, or from whom I may expect
real advantage; and I will, in all my actions, endeavour to
justify that high notion of my capabilities of which I cannot
divest myself. That I will avoid all conversation on serious
subjects, except with those whose opinions I revere, and
content myself with exercising dominion over my own mind,
without trying to influence others. The studies which I
have prescribed to myself are Hebrew and Ante-Nicene
Fathers….”</p>

<p>‘We extract the following philosophical reflections, taken
from the Occasional Thoughts of about the same date, as
similarly characteristic of the author’s steady and systematic
procedure:</p>

<p>‘“<span class="date">Dec. 1, 7</span>, and <span class="date">17</span>.&mdash;It is the object of our lives, by
patient perseverance in a course of action prescribed to us, so
to shape and discipline our desires that they may, through
habit, be excited to the same degree by the objects which are
presented to our understanding, as they would by nature, if
we had senses to relish them; that is, that the degree of our
appetites for these objects should so far exceed that which we
feel for sensible objects, as the known value of the former
exceeds that of the latter. The former field of existence is
what I think <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul had in his mind when he spoke (<abbr title="Hebrews six">Heb.,
vi.</abbr> 19) of ‘that which is within the veil,’ into which Jesus
Christ had gone before us: the veil signifying our unconsciousness,
in spite of which, ‘by two immutable things, in
which it was impossible that God should lie, we might have
<!--351.png--><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a><span class="pageno">315</span>
strong consolation who have fled to lay hold of the hope set
before us.’ All this seems the real meaning of faith, as
insisted on so much in the New Testament.</p>

<p>‘“Of the objects which we pursue or avoid, some we immediately
perceive to be either present or absent; some we
only believe to be so through the intervention of the understanding.
The various dispositions of our fellow-creatures
towards us are of the latter sort. We have no faculties for
perceiving love or admiration; but being conscious of the
feeling ourselves, and recognising in others the effects which
we know to proceed from them, we believe their presence upon
evidence, and are affected therewith. Of being in society we
cannot be conscious, if by society we mean not that of certain
shapes doing certain things, but of beings which feel in some
respects as we do. The existence of such beings we only
believe on evidence, having observed effects like those which
proceed from our own feelings, in so many instances as to
make it appear that the causes are likewise similar. The same
sort of evidence we have of the existence of other beings, in
some respects like, and in others different from ourselves.
That a Being exists endued with power and wisdom, the limits
of which we cannot reach to, is, I think, more certain than that
we have fellow-creatures.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_347" id="fnanchor_347"></a><a href="#footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></span> All men, whether they know it or
not, act as if they believed in a Being endued with intelligence
and power and will, superior to any interference. They count
on the course of Nature continuing as it is, because they know
that what they have long continued to do they go on with;
and rely without any doubt on its skill and ability for perfecting
their undertaking, where their own skill and ability fall
short. That this Being has any other attributes, we have not
the same evidence. These are the ‘things within the veil’;
they are <ins title="kyriôs">κυρίως</ins>, the objects of faith. But consideration will
show that the difference is not in kind but in degree, and
that among what we call the things visible, motives are proposed
to us to be acted on, approaching to it by degrees
imperceptible.”</p>

<p><!--352.png--><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a><span class="pageno">316</span>
‘“<abbr title ="Isaiah 25">Isa. xxv.</abbr> 7, 9. ‘And He will destroy in this mountain
the face of the covering cast over all people, and the veil
that is spread over all nations…. And it shall be said in
that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and
He will save us; this is the Lord; we have waited for Him:
we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation….’</p>

<p>‘“The business of our life seems to be, to acquire the habit
of acting in such a manner as we should do, if we were
conscious of all we know; and in this respect no action of our
lives can be indifferent, but must either tend to form this habit
or a contrary one: so that those whose attempt to act right
does not commence with their power of acting at all, have
much to undo, as well as to do. The craving, and blankness
of feeling, which attends the early stages of this habit (‘show
some token upon me for good’), makes anything acceptable
which can even in fancy fill it; and it is delightful to see things
turn out well, whose case seems, in some sort, to represent to
us our indistinct conceptions of our own. Animals fainting
under the effect of exercise, and then again recovering their
strength, which that very exercise has contributed to increase;
the slow and uncertain degrees in which this exercise is
effected, and yet the certainty that it is effected;&mdash;the growth
of trees sometimes tossed by winds and checked by frosts, yet,
by the evil effects of these winds directed in what quarter to
strike their roots, so as to secure themselves for the future, and
by these frosts hardened and fitted for a new progress the next
summer:&mdash;in things of this sort I am [altered in the <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> from
‘we are’] so constituted, as to see brethren in affliction
evidently making progress towards release….”</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘The impression left on the mind after a first perusal of
the Journal is doubtless a depressing one, both from the
unhappiness which it records, and (it may be) from a fear that
if we would exercise the same strict vigilance over our own
hearts, or would aim at the same high mark, we might find
cause for disquiet too. It is a real satisfaction to find, both at
the end of the Journal that the author considers himself to
have passed into a happier state, and in his Letters, that he
gradually ceases to speak of his own despondency, either
<!--353.png--><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a><span class="pageno">317</span>
openly to his nearest friend, or in those half-jesting hints of
which his other friends must only now feel the meaning. His
external demeanour, both from natural disposition and from
his contempt for any display of feeling, seems always to have
been so full of life and energy, that from it alone, perhaps,
no change in this respect could have been inferred. This
despondency we have not attempted to show in the extracts,
though it does slightly appear there; but rather his high
desires to “enter within the veil,” to be “hidden in the presence
of the Lord,” and the mode which he took to realise
them. This forms a remarkable contrast with the self-confidence
and unreality which too frequently springs from the
consciousness of high views. It is, unfortunately, not often
that we see men of bold and independent minds, subtle and
comprehensive powers of reasoning, and romantic desires,
giving up, till they shall be fit for it, all notion of “influencing
others”; checking, without throwing aside, their own high
feelings; subduing, with a systematic humility, their impulses
to express them, and submitting to learn their duty by the
slow and common-sense process of “following great examples,”
“studying Hebrew and the Ante-Nicene Fathers,” and in the
meantime obeying scrupulously the voices of those whom they
feel to be better than themselves….</p>

<p>‘The volume before us touches the magic keys with a bold
hand; and though some of the notes which come forth are
rather startling, and may be untruly struck, yet there is a
meaning in them which deserves to be analysed by those
defenders of the English Church who are looking about for
weapons to wield, and ground to stand on. Two principal
wants, then, the author seems to have felt in the English
Church: authority, and richness; and that not in the spirit of
a dreaming philosopher, but of one who knew that we were
here not to think only, but to act; that evil was given us that
we might strive against it; Truth, that we might uphold or
restore it; Revelation and moral instincts, that we might know
both one and the other; Talent and energy, that we might form
projects, recommend, and execute them. Nor would the restraints
he set on his impulses to influence others, till circumstances
and a conscious fitness should call him to it, make him
<!--354.png--><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a><span class="pageno">318</span>
likely to shrink from his task when he felt it given him. He
seems early to have thought that his powers would enable him
to serve the Church more effectually as a reader and writer than
as a parochial clergyman: by acting on those minds which are
to guide the masses, [rather] than on the masses themselves. To
this his position as College Fellow seemed also to invite him;
and the following extracts illustrate part of the spirit in which he
devoted himself to this task, and the tastes he sacrificed to it.</p>

does make me a sawney, and that the first <cite>Eclogue</cite> runs in my
head absurdly; but there is more in the prospect of becoming

<p>‘And this introduces us to a side of his character on which
we have as yet scarcely touched: the fertility, buoyancy,
boldness, and versatility of his mind. It has been left
unnoticed, partly because no one who was ever so little
acquainted with the author, or who would read ever so
cursorily the book before us, could well overlook it, partly
because the peculiarities on which we have dwelt seem to have
exercised a far deeper influence in making him what he was.
Both the Journal and the Occasional Thoughts, though
principally interesting as showing the processes by which his
character and opinions formed themselves, and the depth of
thought and determination of purpose on which they were
based, cannot but in part show those too; but in the Letters
we are flooded with the pointed suggestions, the bold historical
views of a keen-sighted politician, the vigorous statements and
earnest queries of one who was seeking and contending for
divine Truth, and the ingenious hints, on questions of taste or
science, of a man of genius who thought nothing unworthy to
employ his powers which could be pressed into the service of
religion….</p>

<p>‘From what has been already said, some general notion
may be gained of the author’s formal opinions. It may be
added, that he was one of those who, feeling strongly the
inadequacy of their own intellects to guide them to religious
<!--356.png--><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a><span class="pageno">320</span>
Truth, are prepared to throw themselves unreservedly on
Revelation wherever found, in Scripture or Antiquity. Any
more definite account it would be difficult to give without
unfairness either to the author or to the reader: to the reader,
if we omitted his more startling views; to the author, if we
stated them detached and unsupported. His Letters seem to
show that his opinions ran somewhat in advance of those to
whom he was most closely bound. Still less should we venture
to pledge ourselves to every statement and suggestion contained
in the two volumes; yet we cannot but express our
hope that they will be very generally read and weighed, as
likely to suggest thoughts on doctrine, on Church policy, and
on individual conduct, most true, and most necessary for
these times.’</p>

<p>‘Keble took us into his house,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_349" id="fnanchor_349"></a><a href="#footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></span> where I formed a most
valued friendship with Froude. He was an Eton man, and
at Oriel of a little older standing than myself. [We found]
religion a reality, and a man wholly made up of love….
Here were many of us, taught with much pains and care by
one till then a stranger, and altogether gratuitously…. Each
of us was always delighted to walk with him, Wilberforce,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_350" id="fnanchor_350"></a><a href="#footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></span> to
gather instruction for the Schools, and the rest of us for love’s
sake…. I spent all this vacation [1823] at Southrop, and,
I think, all my subsequent ones. It was, I think, on this
occasion that John Keble said: “Since you have shown me
your Latin poems, I shall be vain enough to show you my
English ones,” and he then lent me to read what has since
been called <cite>The Christian Year</cite>. It was carefully written out
in small red books. I read it a great deal, but did not much
enter into it. No more did Froude, when he saw it; and, I
<!--357.png--><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a><span class="pageno">321</span>
think, even long after he was averse to the publication of it.
Among other things he said: “People will take Keble for a
Methodist!” At that time I told Keble my favourite poet
was Collins: he said there was not enough thought in him to
please himself. Froude was always maintaining some argument
with Keble, occasionally some monstrous paradox. He
was considered a very odd fellow at College, but clever and
original; Keble alone was able to appreciate and value him.
If he had not at this time fallen into such hands, his speculations
might have taken a very dangerous turn; but as his
father, the Archdeacon, told me, from this time it was much
otherwise: he continued to throw out strong paradoxes, but
always for good.</p>

<p>‘On returning to Oxford, Froude had now taken the place
of my former companions, Keble being a great bond between
us. I think he took more to me than I did to him, because I
had been used to more of worldly refinement and sentiment,
whereas he was unworldly, and real. But still, we were much
united, and became more and more so…. Froude told me,
many years after, that Keble once, before parting from him,
seemed to have something on his mind which he wished to say,
but shrunk from saying. At last, while waiting, I think, for a
coach, he said to him before parting: “Froude, you said one
day that Law’s <cite>Serious Call</cite> was a clever” (or “pretty,” I forgot
which) “book: it seemed to me as if you had said the
Day of Judgement would be a pretty sight.” This speech,
Froude told me, had a great effect on his after-life; and I
observed that in the published Letters in Froude’s <cite>Remains</cite>, he
twice alludes to it…. Henry Ryder (like Wilberforce) had
been brought up in a strict Evangelical school of the better
kind; and on one occasion got up and left a College party in
consequence of something that Froude had said that seemed
to him to be of a light kind. But when he afterwards came
to know the deep self-humiliation and depth of devotion there
was in Froude’s character, which was engaged in the discipline
of the heart, he became so shocked with himself and his own
opinions, that he adopted the opposite course….</p>

<p>‘It was in August, 1825, that I first went with Froude
into Devonshire. We went by a steamer from Cowes to Plymouth,
<!--358.png--><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a><span class="pageno">322</span>
as described in a letter in Froude’s <cite>Remains</cite> (Part <abbr title="one, Volume one">i., Vol.
i.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 181). From Totnes, we walked up the Dart by Dartington
House to the Parsonage: that place which ever since has been
to me dearer than my native vales, of which I always say:</p>

<p class="center small">‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ille terrarum mihi præter omnes Angulus ridet.</cite></p>

<p>‘The Froudes were eight in family, and the Archdeacon
became a great friend. But the people after my own heart
were at Dartington House.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_351" id="fnanchor_351"></a><a href="#footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></span> … With the Archdeacon and
Hurrell we rode along the coast, being very hospitably entertained
at different houses; and at last, from the Holdsworths’
house at Dartmouth we came up the river Dart by boat….
Prevost, [the] summer of 1826, came to Cwm,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_352" id="fnanchor_352"></a><a href="#footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></span> and was engaged
to my sister; and afterwards Froude came there too, and gives
an account of his stay there in his published Journal, where I am
mentioned under the letter I., and Prevost under that of P.
All this time I was very unwell, and preying on my own mind.
I went to Oxford to reside my Bachelor’s term, and lived with
Sir Charles Anderson, and saw much of Froude, who was very
kind to me. I went to Dartington, with the Archdeacon, from
Oxford, and spent the Easter there…. When I went to reside
in Oxford, in October, [1831], as College Tutor, I felt what a
great change had come on my mind since residing there before,
on account of the influence of Bisley<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_353" id="fnanchor_353"></a><a href="#footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></span> and Windrush,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_354" id="fnanchor_354"></a><a href="#footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></span> and I
found this the more on returning to the society of Froude, for
I was become so much more soft and practical, and he more
theoretical and speculative…. Yet this change that had been
going on, from difference of circumstances, in no way lessened
my friendship and intimacy with Froude, but rather increased
it; for though naturally inclined to speculation, he was himself
entirely of the Keble school, which in opposition to the Oriel
or Whatelian, set <ins title="êthos">ἦθος</ins> above intellect…. Living at that time
so much with Froude, I was now, in consequence, for the first
time, brought into intercourse with Newman; we almost daily
<!--359.png--><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a><span class="pageno">323</span>
walked and dined together. Newman and Froude were just
then turned out of their tutorships at Oriel, together with
Robert Wilberforce, who left Oxford for his living of East
Farleigh. Their course had, as yet, been chiefly academical,
but now, released from College affairs, their thoughts were
more open to the state of the Church…. I was greatly
charmed and delighted with Newman, who was extremely kind
to me; but [I] did not altogether trust his opinions. Although
Froude was in the habit of stating things in an extreme and
paradoxical manner, yet one always felt conscious of a thorough
foundation of truth and principle in him, a ground of entire
confidence and agreement; but this was not so with Newman,
even although one appeared more in unison with his more
moderate statements.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_355" id="fnanchor_355"></a><a href="#footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></span> … At this time he was coming to look
to Keble altogether, as he received him second-hand through
Froude…. But I always thought Froude an unfair exponent
of Keble’s opinions: they were stated by him in a manner so
much his own, so startling and original, and put in so extreme
a light, that I could hardly recognise them as the same, so
different was his from Keble’s manner of expressing himself.
[<em>Note.</em>&mdash;Froude used to defend his startling way of putting
facts and arguments on the ground that it was the only way
to rouse people, and get their attention; and he said that when
you had once done this, you might modify your statements.
There is, of course, some truth in this, but it always seemed,
and still seems to me, a dangerous line. John Keble could
not do so: his great humility and diffidence would prevent
it, and that strict conscientiousness which hindered him from
even willingly overstating any fact, or pressing any argument,
beyond what he said it really did prove….]</p>

<p>‘… The circumstance which I most remember about that
time<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_356" id="fnanchor_356"></a><a href="#footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></span> was a conversation with Froude which was the first
<!--360.png--><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a><span class="pageno">324</span>
commencement of the <cite>Tracts for the Times</cite>. He returned
full of energy and of a prospect of doing something for the
Church; and we walked in the Trinity College gardens, and
discussed the subject. He said, in his manner: “Isaac, we
must make a row in the world! Why should we not? Only
consider what the Peculiars” (<i>i.e.</i> the Evangelicals) “have
done with a few half-truths to work upon! And with our
principles, if we set resolutely to work, we can do the same.”
I said: “I have no doubt we can make a noise, and may get
people to join us; but shall we make them really better
Christians? If they take up our principles in a hollow way, as
the Peculiars” (this was a name Froude had given the Low
Church party) “have done theirs, what good shall we do?”
To this Froude said: “Church principles, forced on people’s
notice, must work for good. However, we must try; and
Newman and I are determined to set to work as soon as he
returns, and you must join with us. We must have short
tracts, and letters in <cite>The British Magazine</cite>, and verses (and
these you can do for us), and get people to preach sermons on
the Apostolical Succession and the like. And let us come
and see old Palmer” (<i>i.e.</i> the author of the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Origines Liturgicæ</cite>)
“and get him to do something.” We then called on Palmer,
who was one of the very few in Oxford (indeed, the only one
at that time) who sympathised with us; and although he did
not altogether understand Froude, or our ways and views (the
less so as he was not himself an Oxford, but a Dublin man),
yet he was extremely hearty in the cause, looking more to
external visible union and strength than we did, for we only
had at heart certain principles. We, <i>i.e.</i>, Froude, Keble, and
myself, immediately began to send some verses to <cite>The British
Magazine</cite>, since published [in] the <cite>Lyra Apostolica</cite>….</p>

<p>‘… From this time forth, after Newman’s return, I was
thrown more and more entirely into his society for about seven
years, Froude waning more and more away, and disappearing
from Oxford….</p>

<p>‘… I much regretted not being with poor Froude at or
nearly before his death…. Poor Froude! he was peculiarly
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vir paucorum hominum</i>: I thought that knowing him, I better
understood Shakespeare’s Hamlet. Froude was a person most
<!--361.png--><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a><span class="pageno">325</span>
natural, but so original as to be unlike anyone else, hiding
depth of delicate thought in apparent extravagances. <cite>Hamlet</cite>
and the <cite>Georgics</cite> of Virgil, he used to say, he should have
bound together. Many have imagined, and Newman endeavoured
to persuade himself, that if Froude had lived he
would have joined the Church of Rome, as well as himself.
But this I do not at all think. There was a seriousness and
steadfastness, at the bottom, in Froude, so that I had always
confidence in him:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_357" id="fnanchor_357"></a><a href="#footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></span> Newman told me once, half-seriously, that
the publication of Froude’s <cite>Remains</cite> was owing to me, as I had
said to him, if persons could have so much brought before
them that they could thoroughly understand Froude’s character,
then they might enter into his sayings; but unless they knew
him as we did, they could not understand them. For, indeed,
one constantly trembled for him in mixed society, both in
Common Rooms and in other places, feeling that he would
not be understood…. On the day of the book coming out,
I went into Parker the bookseller’s with Copeland; and there
we were startled at seeing one who then was the chief opponent
of the Church principles of Newman and ourselves. It was
Ward of Balliol, author of the <cite>Ideal</cite>. He sat down with the
book in his hands, evidently much affected; and then we
afterwards heard, to our astonishment, that he had been very
much taken by the book, had bought a copy for himself and
another to give away, and was, in fact, quite converted.’</p>

  <div class="i0a">‘It was before the summer holidays,</div>
  <div class="i0">A noon I well remember, as we sat</div>
  <div class="i0">Conversing in my College rooms, my thoughts</div>
  <div class="i0">Mingling unconscious with the trembling leaves</div>
  <div class="i0">Of poplars from the window; and meanwhile,</div>
  <div class="i0">In converse still unbroken, thence we passed</div>
  <div class="i0">Into the stately garden-walks, and there</div>
  <div class="i0">Paced to and fro beside the aged yews</div>
  <div class="i0">Which once like living guardians of the lawn</div>
  <div class="i0">Had marshalled all the place with verdant walls:</div>
  <div class="i0">Now, mere memorials of their former sway.</div>
  <div class="i0">’Twas a dark vapoury noon, while ruddy gleams</div>
  <div class="i0">Were mingling with the sun, and fell athwart</div>
  <div class="i0">The cloistral lime-tree avenue beyond;</div>
  <div class="i0">And like a curtain, the moist atmosphere</div>

  <div class="i0">Glowing and warm, not adverse to my friend</div>
  <div class="i0">(Lately returned from genial Italy,</div>

  <div class="i0">For he was worthy of a good man’s love.</div>
  <div class="i0">“Yes,” said he, with my name, as he was wont,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sportfully playing, “we must make a noise</div>
  <div class="i0">In the large world; why should we not? How they</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Low Church views, Peculiar, through the land</div>
  <div class="i0">Make themselves felt and heard; and ring aloud</div>
  <div class="i0">With a few truths, half-truths! and shall not we</div>

  <div class="i0">Or, rather, say the Faith entire and one</div>
  <div class="i0">In all its due proportions, and the Church</div>
  <div class="i0">Our witness of old time,&mdash;why should we not</div>
  <div class="i0">Lift up, as like a trumpet through the land,</div>
  <div class="i0">With no uncertain sound, our warning voice?”</div>
 </div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">My answer I remember: “Noise abroad</div>
  <div class="i0">I doubt not we can make as well as they.</div>
  <div class="i0">And then to be as hollow partisans,</div>
  <div class="i0">Supporters,&mdash;this were easy, and the Church</div>
  <div class="i0">To be familiar in men’s mouths; but then</div>
  <div class="i0">Will they beneath all this be better men,</div>
  <div class="i0">More humble?”</div>
 </div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="i4">“They will be so,” he replied.</div>
  <div class="i0">“For the great Truths themselves, depend on it,</div>
  <div class="i0">Will work, and work for good; but hollow men</div>
  <div class="i0">There will be, and needs must.”</div>
 </div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="i6">Yet, to and fro,</div>
  <div class="i0">I urged the adverse part: “I fear the weight</div>
  <div class="i0">On spirits unprepared, undisciplined;</div>
  <div class="i0">Of others and ourselves I am afraid.</div>
  <div class="i0">Could men be fuller leavened with the thought</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Judgement and Hereafter, could we lay</div>
  <div class="i0">Foundations deep in honesty, ’twere well;</div>
  <div class="i0">But else, mere superstructure on the sand!</div>
  <div class="i0">Fashion, religious fashion, and the tide</div>
  <div class="i0">Of popular feelings,&mdash;I can never wish</div>
  <div class="i0">To have them with us. We must walk in doubt</div>
  <div class="i0">And fear, and do our parts, come what come may.”</div>
 </div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">“Yes,” said he, pausing, “very true”: with look</div>
  <div class="i0">Half-loving and half-pitying. “My friend,</div>
  <div class="i0">You now must creep no more; for all too long</div>
  <div class="i0">You have in country hamlets shady grown.</div>
  <div class="i0">For part of this our duty, ere we die,</div>

  <div class="i0">Else all that’s good and holy in the land,</div>
  <div class="i0">Beneath the blasting influence of the State</div>
  <div class="i0">Will wither and dry up and droop and die,</div>
  <div class="i0">As neath the upas-tree. We must be up,</div>
  <div class="i0">And moving, now, at once; and when our friend</div>
  <div class="i0">Shall have returned from ancient Sicily,”</div>
  <div class="i0">(He spake of one whom he had left behind</div>
  <div class="i0">Bound for the classic shores of Syracuse),</div>
  <div class="i0">“Tracts we must have, and, by what means we can,</div>
  <div class="i0">Launch them abroad, short Tracts; we must begin,</div>

  <div class="i0">But deeper the foundations must be laid</div>
  <div class="i0">In these our Tracts; subsidial aid we need,</div>
  <div class="i0">Full many: to get friends (if here and there</div>
  <div class="i0">One may be found, or two) to bring to aid</div>
  <div class="i0">Their pulpits, and proclaim there is a Church</div>
  <div class="i0">Planted by Christ’s own hand within our isle.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">And let us now to Worcester.” Then of one</div>
  <div class="i0">He spake, well-honoured for good service done</div>
  <div class="i0">Linking our Liturgies unto the past.</div>
  <div class="i0">“Hearty he is, and earnest; though not meet</div>
  <div class="i0">Throughout to understand and sympathise,</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet in his line will lend us his good aid,</div>
  <div class="i0">Though looking for external front, and powers,</div>
  <div class="i0">More than on principles which we are bent</div>

  <div class="i0">And thus, full-sailed in academic garb,</div>
  <div class="i0">Through the Collegiate gates, archway, and porch</div>

  <div class="i0">To talk in paradox, it was his mood</div>
  <div class="i0">Of playfulness, as one that inly smiled</div>
  <div class="i0">Mocking at the conceptions which the tongue</div>
  <div class="i0">Is weak to utter; venting heart-felt truths</div>
  <div class="i0">In startling shape preposterous; with a smile</div>
  <div class="i0">At incongruity of our poor thoughts</div>

  <div class="i0">His intellect was keen-edged as the sword</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Saladin, well-matched with battle-axe</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Cœur de Lion; while in poetry</div>
  <div class="i0">And arts, his judgement was the sculptor’s nail;</div>
  <div class="i0">But, like the royal Dane of Shakespeare wrought,</div>
  <div class="i0">One by himself, not of a class or kind:</div>

  <div class="i2">There was within him such repose on Truth,</div>
  <div class="i0">Absence of self, such heart-controlling fear,</div>
  <div class="i0">I feel that, had he lived, he had not been</div>
  <div class="i0">The sport of his own sails, or popular winds</div>
  <div class="i0">That he had courted for our object’s sake.</div>

<p>‘The friendship between Newman and Mr. Hurrell Froude,
the elder brother of the historian, which commenced in 1826,
and became intimate in 1829, lasting thence to Mr. Froude’s
death from consumption in 1836, was certainly one of the
most important influences which acted on Newman’s career at
the most critical period of his life. Newman’s was one of the
minds which mature slowly; and it was not till he was
<!--366.png--><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a><span class="pageno">330</span>
twenty-six years of age that it became clear whether he would
be, in the main, a religious leader, or one of the pillars of the
Whately party; that is, the party who threw their influence
into the scale of minimising the spiritual aspect and spiritual
significance of Revelation, rather than of maximising it.
Newman himself mentions that for two or three years before
1827, he was “beginning to prefer intellectual excellence to
moral,” or, in other words, “drifting in the direction of
Liberalism.” “I was rudely awakened from my dream, at the
end of 1827, by two great blows, illness and bereavement.”
And then, in 1829, came fuller intimacy with Hurrell Froude,
which seems to have fully determined, if anything were then
needed to determine, the direction in which his mind would
proceed. Mr. Hurrell Froude was, as Newman describes him,
a man of the highest gifts, gentle, tender, playful, versatile and
“of the most winning patience and considerateness in discussion.” …
I feel little doubt that Dr. Newman’s wrath against
“Liberalism” (as for many years afterwards he always called
it, identifying, as he did, Liberalism with Latitudinarianism)
was, to a very considerable extent, a moral contagion caught
from Hurrell Froude.</p>

<p>‘There are a few singularly beautiful lines, added by
Newman after Hurrell Froude’s death, to the exquisite poem
called “Separation of Friends,” written in 1833; and these
sufficiently prove the tenderness of Newman’s friendship for
Hurrell Froude, and the intimacy of the relation between them.
The poem, as it was first written, on the separation of friends
caused by death, ran thus:</p>

</div><!--end poem-->

<p>‘This was an abrupt close. Nearly three years later, it
appeared that the true close had but been reserved till the
friend with whom, in his illness, Newman had been travelling,
had left him alone here to offer this “speechless intercession”
on behalf of him who had departed. Then, after Froude’s
death on February 28, 1836, Newman added the final lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container no-break">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">‘“Ah, dearest! with a word he could dispel</div>
  <div class="i2">All questioning, and raise</div>
  <div class="i0">Our hearts to rapture, whispering all was well,</div>
  <div class="i2">And turning prayer to praise.</div>
  <div class="i0">And other secrets, too, he could declare,</div>
  <div class="i2">By patterns all divine,</div>
  <div class="i0">His earthly creed retouching here and there,</div>
  <div class="i2">And deepening every line.</div>
  <div class="i0">Dearest! he longs to speak, as I to know,</div>
  <div class="i2">And yet we both refrain.</div>
  <div class="i0">It were not good: a little doubt, below,</div>
  <div class="i2">And all will soon be plain.”</div>

<p>‘Such was Newman’s feeling for the friend (already suffering
from the commencement of the consumption of which he died
three years later) with whom he visited the Mediterranean
between December, 1832, and April, 1833, when they
separated at Rome…. They visited Ithaca, but in his poems
written “off Ithaca” Newman never mentions the name of
Ulysses, though in passing Lisbon he had recalled that strong
pagan figure, in the lines which he headed “The Isles of
the Sirens”:</p>

</div><!--end poem-container-->

<p>‘There you see some trace of the influence of Froude’s
high ascetic nature speaking in the heart of a devotee of
music, but a devotee of music of the most exalted kind.
Hurrell Froude, in a letter home, mentions that the commander
of the steamer in which they sailed sang several songs,
accompanying himself on the Spanish guitar, and it must have
been these songs which suggested to Newman “The Isles of
the Sirens.” When the friends reach Ithaca, Newman seems to
forget “the man of many woes” altogether; he is musing on
the difficulty of keeping himself “unspotted from the world”:
which is the last thing, I suppose, that Homer’s Ulysses ever
thought about; while Byron, in the same scenes, thought
only of how he could spot himself most effectually….
Newman’s nostalgia was more in sympathy with that of
Moses than with that of Ulysses: the home he longed for was
a home he had never yet gained. There is something very
strange in the connection between these classical scenes and
the thoughts they excited in the travellers, for I cannot help
thinking that most of these poems must have owed their
origin almost as much to Froude’s suggestion as to Newman’s
pen. The lines, for instance, on England,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_359" id="fnanchor_359"></a><a href="#footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></span> in which Newman
calls her “Tyre of the West,” and accuses her of trusting in
such poor defences as the fortified rock of Gibraltar, and such
poor resources as her rich commerce supplied, look as if they
had owed a good deal of their inspiration to Froude’s cavalier
contempt for the wealth earned by trade, as well as his scorn
for any ostentatious display of power not rooted in a devout
theocratic Faith…. There is, to me, something very striking
in the contrast between the class of thoughts which the old
<!--369.png--><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a><span class="pageno">333</span>
Greek and Roman localities suggest to a Whig poet like
Byron, with a broad dash of licence in his Whiggery; to
classical scholars like Clough, imbued with what is now called
“the modern spirit” (as well its moral earnestness as its
intellectual scepticism), and to grave spirits like Newman’s
and Hurrell Froude’s, dominated not only by a religious, but
by a strongly-marked ecclesiastical bias…. As regards the
influence of this journey on Newman’s future career, it appears
that while, in many respects, it diminished his horror of
Romanism, in consequence especially of the influence of
Hurrell Froude, it had a contrary effect on Hurrell Froude’s
own mind, and later (again, through him, to some extent, I
suppose) on Newman’s. Hurrell Froude writes from Naples<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_360" id="fnanchor_360"></a><a href="#footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></span>
on February 17, 1833: “I remember you told me that
I should come back a better Englishman than I went away:
better satisfied not only that our Church is nearest in theory
right, but also that practically, in spite of its abuses, it works
better; and to own the truth, your prophecy is already nearly
realised. Certainly, I have as yet only seen the surface of
things, but what I have seen does not come up to my notions
of propriety. These Catholic countries seem, in an especial
manner, <ins title="katechein tên alêtheian en adikia">κατέχειν τῆν ἀλήθειαν ἐν ἀδικία</ins>, and the priesthood
are themselves so sensible of the hollow basis on which
their power rests, that they dare not resist the most atrocious
encroachments of the State upon their privileges.” And after
detailing the abuses of the Roman Catholic system in Sicily,
he goes on: “The Church of England has fallen low, and will
probably be worse before it is better; but let the Whigs do
<!--370.png--><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a><span class="pageno">334</span>
their worst, they cannot sink us so deep as these people have
allowed themselves to fall, while retaining all the superficials
of a religious country.” When it is considered that this was
the impression of Roman Catholicism, judged by its fruits,
which that one of the two friends who was by far the more inclined
to the Roman system brought away from his life in a
Roman Catholic country, we cannot wonder that Newman should
have remained for eight more years a zealous Anglican, before
he even began to foresee clearly whither he was tending.’</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">From ‘<span class="smcap">The Anglican Revival</span>,’ by <span class="smcap">J. H. Overton</span>,
<abbr title="Doctor of Divinity">D.D.</abbr>, Rector of Epworth and Canon of Lincoln.
London: Blackie &amp; Son, 1897.</p>

<p class="center small">[By the kind permission of Messrs. Blackie &amp; Son.]</p>

<p>‘The fact is that [in 1833] Rose, Palmer, and perhaps
Perceval on the one hand, Froude, Keble, and Newman on the
other, represented, not exactly two different parties, but two
different classes of mind. The former group were essentially
conservative: they did not share the dissatisfaction with the
Church as it was, which was so strongly felt by Keble,
Newman, and Froude; they only desired to see it freed from
what they regarded as the oppression of the State. They
were very different types of men, Rose representing the brilliant
and fascinating, Palmer the learned, and Perceval the aristocratic
or territorial element. But none of them was prepared to
follow what Newman calls the “go-ahead” course, for which
he and Froude were ready, and from which Keble was not at
all averse…. As a matter of fact, the Movement was carried
on by the latter, not by the former group.</p>

<p>‘… Pusey’s adherence was an instance of the right man
coming in just at the right time. The public had now [1835]
been fairly aroused; they had had sufficiently impressed upon
them the duty of maintaining Church principles; they had now
a right to demand that those principles should be fully and
definitely explained to them in detail. The time for short,
stirring appeals was over; the time for solid, sober treatises on
divinity had arrived…. [Pusey’s] mild and conciliatory spirit
<!--371.png--><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a><span class="pageno">335</span>
introduced a healing element into the Movement which was
certainly needed. The “fierceness” (to use his own expression)
of Newman, and especially of Newman when “kept up to the
mark by Froude,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_361" id="fnanchor_361"></a><a href="#footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></span> had the very natural effect of raising
opposition; and even in Keble, the gentle, humble Keble, there
was a strong spice, if not exactly of fierceness, yet of a
tendency to give vent to the most unpopular sentiments in the
most uncompromising way, without the slightest attempt to
tone them down. Pusey, again, was far more apt to recognise
two sides of a question than was Keble, Newman, or
Froude…. The Movement gained Pusey, and lost Hurrell
Froude, almost at the same time. When Pusey joined the
party, Froude was practically a dying man; and in February
28, 1836, to the infinite regret of his many friends, he died at
his native Dartington. With Froude passed away the most
daring and “go-ahead” spirit connected with the whole Movement.
Newman was enthusiastic, but Froude was far more
so; Newman waged war against the complacency which was
so characteristic of the old Church party, but Froude was still
more exasperated against it; Newman was not over-cautious
in his invectives against the fallacies and prejudices of the age,
but Froude was ten times less so. With an intense earnestness
and thoroughness of conviction, with a fiery energy which
would ride over anything, with a courage which sometimes
amounted to audacity, and with an irresistibly attractive
personality, there is no saying what would have happened if
his short life had been prolonged! But it is not a very
profitable speculation to conjecture what might have been.
Suffice it to say that in one respect the influence of Froude
was likely to have had exactly the opposite effect to that of
Pusey. The one seemed, of all men, the most calculated to
trouble the waters, the other, to pour oil upon them; and the
fact that Froude dropped out just when Pusey began to make
his influence felt, seemed to promise that henceforth the Movement
would create less hostility. After events, however, proved
that this was not to be the case; and the causes are not far to
seek….</p>

<p><!--372.png--><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a><span class="pageno">336</span>
‘One of the most startling … events was the appearance,
in 1838, of the first series of Froude’s <cite>Remains</cite>, edited by
Keble and Newman jointly. It is not surprising that this
publication raised a violent outcry: it gave to the world the
off-hand utterances of a young enthusiast whose opinions would
probably have toned down with age, but were here expressed
with all the recklessness of inexperience, and were only intended,
in the first instance, to be read by sympathetic friends.</p>

<p>‘His views on the English Reformation and Reformers
were sufficiently startling. “The present Church system is an
incubus upon the country”; “the Reformation was a limb badly
set: it must be broken again in order to be righted”; the
English Reformers generally were “a set of men with whom
[I wish] to have less and less to do”; Jewel, in particular, was
“an irreverent Dissenter”; Latimer, “a Martyr somewhat in the
Bulteel line.” One can conceive the horror with which such
sentiments would be read by men with whom “our happy
Establishment in Church and State,” “our glorious Reformation,”
and “our martyred Reformers” were almost articles of
faith!</p>

<p>‘It has been thought that the Editors miscalculated the
effect which the book would produce; but the theory is not
very complimentary to their judgement. Surely must they
have known that the glamour of Froude’s personality would
not affect the general, still less the hostile, reader (and his
name was legion), who would greedily seize upon any handle
which could be turned, as Froude could so easily be, against
the Movement. Moreover, how does it agree with the fact that
when they found out their mistake, they nevertheless published
in the following year, 1839, a second series as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</i> as the
first? And this they introduced with a Preface pointing out
how Froude’s sagacity had anticipated all the improvements
that had taken place, and representing him, not as a disturber
of the people, but as a prophet indeed. This Preface
is said to have been chiefly the work of Keble, and it
is highly characteristic of the man, though not of the
popular conception of him: for Keble was always for the
bold course.</p>

<p>‘The other Editor, Newman, writing to his friend Frederic
<!--373.png--><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a><span class="pageno">337</span>
Rogers in July, 1837, gives six reasons why Froude’s private
letters should be published; and to his Co-editor he writes
at the same time: “We have often said the Movement
must be enthusiastic. Now here is a man fitted above all
others to kindle enthusiasm.” May it not have been that
both Editors put forth the <cite>Remains</cite> with their eyes perfectly
wide open as to what the result would be? that
they were not unwilling the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enfant terrible</i> of the Movement
should say his say, and startle the public? The public was
startled: it took in all seriousness the audacious dicta of
Froude as if they were stamped with the approval of the
whole party, which it denounced with increased vigour,
accordingly.</p>

<p>‘It is impossible to help connecting with the publication
of Froude’s <cite>Remains</cite> the starting of that project which gave
to Oxford one of the most beautiful of its many beautiful
monuments, the “Martyrs’ Memorial,” opposite Balliol College,
on the spot on which Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer had been
burnt.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_362" id="fnanchor_362"></a><a href="#footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></span> The greatest offence of Froude was that he had
spoken disparagingly of the English Reformers generally, and
of these men in particular. The project of the Memorial
originated in a small meeting held towards the close of 1838,
at Oriel, in the rooms of Mr. Golightly, who, having begun as
a friend of the Movement, had soon become its bitterest and
most persistent foe. Everybody seems to have connected the
Memorial with the <cite>Remains</cite>; but there was some division of
opinion as to the course which should be pursued. Keble and
Newman were from the first opposed to the project, and so
were moderate men like Palmer and Benjamin Harrison. But
Hook and S. Wilberforce were in favour, and so, strange to
say, was Pusey, to a certain extent, at first, until he was
persuaded otherwise by Keble and Newman…. Keble
writes to Pusey … “I am not at all prepared to express a
public dissent from Froude in his opinion of the Reformers as
a party.” On the other hand, S. Wilberforce writes to Hook,
regretting that “our good Oxford friends run down Reformers,
and will not subscribe to the Martyrs’ Memorial.” It was said
<!--374.png--><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a><span class="pageno">338</span>
of the Memorial, “it will be a good cut against Newman”:
but it was not a cut which made him smart.’</p>

<p>‘It is not often that the leaders of opinions let the public
into a view of their secret counsels and feelings; but when
they do, we think it does credit to the uprightness and
sincerity of their intentions…. Nay, the more unreservedly
the human weaknesses of the individuals are revealed, and
the more the feeling is expressed that with their exposure, or
in spite of it, their cause will succeed, the more highly we
shall estimate their confidence in the correctness of their views,
and the disinterestedness of their zeal in propagating them.
These reflections have been suggested to us by the perusal
of Mr. Froude’s <cite>Remains</cite>. He was, while living, one of the
most enthusiastic members of the theological school from
which the <cite>Tracts for the Times</cite> have emanated. He died in
1836, having attained only the age of thirty-three;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_364" id="fnanchor_364"></a><a href="#footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></span> and was
thus prevented from arriving at that full maturity of religious
ideas which was evidently preparing in his mind, and bearing
him onwards towards the perception of Catholic truths.</p>

<p>‘A preface of twenty-two pages betrays the Editors’ anxiety
to repel a twofold charge: one against themselves, the other
against their deceased friend…. When one whose noble and
public proofs of great virtue far outweigh the errors of youth,
or whose public reputation makes his example, when evil, a
warning; and when repentant, a reparation and an encouragement,&mdash;when
one, in short, like <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine, boldly but
humbly reveals to the eyes of the Church the wretchedness
of his early sinful life, we admire, in awe, the strange manifestation
of a sublime spirit of Christian virtue, and we bless
the Divine Wisdom that hath caused it to be vouchsafed to
us. But the struggles of one who has not compensated his
<!--375.png--><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a><span class="pageno">339</span>
weaknesses by any noble results, who withdraws from our
sight a combatant, and not a victor; who only presents us
the spectacle of a frail nature, such as we all may have,
wrestling with daily and anxious trials, and not overcoming
them; (these, too, not spontaneously exhibited, but transferred
from the closet to the public arena)&mdash;have neither the grandeur
nor the instruction of the other lesson. Still, there may be
reasons unknown to us who are not in the secrets of the
party, to justify, certainly in their own eyes, this sacrifice of
private feeling to a sense of public utility…. [The Editors]
would have materially strengthened their reasoning by the following
passage in [Mr. Froude’s] Letters to Friends: “There
was a passage in a letter I have just received from my father,
which made me feel so infinitely dismal that I must write to
you about it. He says you have written to him to learn
something about me, and to ask what to do with my money.
It really made me feel as if I was dead, and you were sweeping
up my remains: and by the by, if I were dead, why should
I be cut off from the privilege of helping on the Good Cause?
I don’t know what money I have left,&mdash;little enough, I suspect;
but whatever it was, I am superstitious enough to think
that any good it could do <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in honorem Dei et sacrosanctæ matris
ecclesiæ</i>, would have done something, too, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in salutem animæ
meæ</i>.” From these words, it appears that the author did
contemplate his power of doing good to the cause wherein
he was so ardently engaged, even after his death.</p>

<p>‘The censure of their friend which the Editors foresee,
is that which forms their bugbear in all their theological
researches: that of approaching too near the Catholic, or, as
they call it, Romanist doctrines. But we must express our
conviction that the Editors have not done much credit to their
friend by the manner in which they have thought it right to
shield his memory from the charge. It consists in a careful
collection of some of the most hasty, unhandsome, and decidedly
unreasonable judgements and opinions of the author, respecting
chiefly what he saw in his travels…. We think we are justified
in saying that proof of Mr. Froude’s disinclination to Catholicity
must have been very scarce, to have led the Editors to
bring together these superficial observations made during a
<!--376.png--><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a><span class="pageno">340</span>
brief residence in a Catholic city<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_365" id="fnanchor_365"></a><a href="#footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></span> not generally reputed the
most edifying in its conduct! These, however, will not bear
comparison with the growing and expanding tendency of his
mind towards everything Catholic….</p>

<p>‘… The extracts from [his] Journal present us a picture
at once pleasing and distressing, of a mind yearning after
interior perfection, yet at a loss about the means of attaining
it; embarked on an ocean of good desires, but without stars
or compass by which to steer its course. The minute scrutiny
into the motives of his actions, the distress occasioned by
discovering his relapses into faults which most would overlook,
show a sensitiveness of conscience in the youthful writer, far
more honourable to him, and far more interesting to us, than
abilities of a much higher order than what he really possessed
could ever have appeared…. How far it may be advisable
to commit to paper, even for personal benefit, these investigations
of our most secret tribunal, we have considerable doubt;
and instructive as is their record in the case before us, in
nothing is it more so than in the proof it gives us of the
necessity of guidance for the conscience and heart such as
the institutions of the Catholic Church alone provide. In
the account which he gives of his own infirmities, of his
almost fruitless attempts to subdue them, and of the pain and
anxiety produced by his solitary struggles, he presents a
picture familiar to the experienced eye of any spiritual director
in our Church, and a state fully described and prescribed for
by the numerous writers whom we possess upon the inward
life and the direction of consciences. Many are they who are
tossed in the same billows of secret tribulation, many are
they who are bewildered in the same mazes of mental perplexity;
but they have not at least the additional horrors of
darkness and night. Ere they can sink, a hand is stretched
out, if they will only grasp it. The troubles and trials which
haunt minds constituted as Mr. Froude’s, many a skilful guide
would have shown him to be mere illusive phantoms that
only serve to turn the attention away from serious dangers,
or from solid good: snares cast by a restlessness of spirit
upon the path, to entangle the feet that tread it…. The
<!--377.png--><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a><span class="pageno">341</span>
consequence of all his irregular and undirected austerity, into
which, with youthful eagerness, he rushed, was, that instead
of deriving thence vigour of thought, and closer intimacy with
some spiritual feelings, his spirit, on the contrary, flagged and
at length grew weary, and so fell into that despondency which
failure will produce in sensitive minds. This discouragement
is visible in many parts of his Journal…. In fact, Mr. Froude
discovered that most important principle, that obedience to
the ordinances of authority gives the great merit to the first
degrees of penitential works, those which belong to ordinary
Christians: such, that is, as have not reached the perfection
of ascetic life…. While he seems so taken up, through his
Journals, with examination of his fasts and austerities, we miss
from his pages those cheerful views of religion which result
from confidence and love, from the consciousness of a strong
will to do [God] service, and an humble reliance on His mercy
which will measure that, rather than our success. What
snatches there are of prayer, bear more the character of one
sinking under the fatigue of foiled attempts, and troubled with
anxiety from hopelessness of success, than of a young and
trusting mind that presses forward to a work it deems glorious:
the work of God and His religion….</p>

<p>‘We certainly think that his ardent way, more perhaps of
expressing himself than of feeling, leads him often to a harsh
and reckless manner of speaking of others, that must give an
unfavourable impression regarding his character, which we
have every reason to believe was amiable and gentle. Still,
there are so many fine points about him: so much distrust
of himself, blended with no inconsiderable powers of genius;
so much independence of thought, coupled with deference to
the sentiments of others, those he esteemed more learned or
more virtuous than himself; so much lightness of spirit, united
to such seriousness of mind upon religious truths;&mdash;in fine,
so earnest and sincere a desire to improve and perfect himself,
that our feelings lead us to pass lightly over his faults, and
dwell with pleasure upon his finer qualities. If we have
dilated somewhat upon the former, it has been that we considered
them the result of the system to which he was by
education attached, and which is alone accountable for them.</p>

<p><!--378.png--><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a><span class="pageno">342</span>
‘As, however, he increased in years, his mind began to
open to the defects and wants of that system, and boldly to
conceive the necessity of correcting them. In this he ran
manifestly before his fellows, and seems only to have been
prevented by his premature death from reaching the goal of
Catholic Unity…. First, as to the Blessed Eucharist, we
find him early desirous of going beyond the timid phraseology
of his party, and attributing to the priesthood such power
as the Catholic Church alone claims…. In 1835, he condemns
what he calls the Protestant doctrine of the Eucharist
in strong terms. These are his words: “I am more and more
indignant at the Protestant doctrine on the subject of the
Eucharist, and think that the principle on which it is founded
is as proud, irreverent, and foolish as that of any heresy, even
Socinianism.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_366" id="fnanchor_366"></a><a href="#footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></span> Still more, writing to the author of <cite>The
Christian Year</cite>, he blames him for denying that Christ is in
the hands of the priest or the receiver, as well as in his heart.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_367" id="fnanchor_367"></a><a href="#footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></span>
These passages show how far prepared he was to outstrip his
friends in approximation to Catholic doctrines and Catholic
expressions…. The state of celibacy, and with it the
monastic life, seems also to have been an object of his
admiration…. The last fragment published of his attests
how anxiously, how candidly, and how powerfully his mind
was at work with the great subject [of Church authority],
the hinge on which the differences between us and these new
divines may be justly said to turn. This piece<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_368" id="fnanchor_368"></a><a href="#footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></span> is a letter dated
<abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 27, 1836, a month before his death; and as his last illness
was of some weeks’ duration, this document may be considered
as his theological will and testament, the last declaration of his
yet unbroken mind…. After this, what more can we desire
in proof of what we asserted at the beginning of this article,
that these <cite>Remains</cite> prove Mr. Froude’s mind to have been
gradually discovering more extensive and more accurate views
of religious truths and the principles of Faith, with such steady
and constant growth as gives us every reason to believe that
longer life alone was wanting, to see him take the salutary
<!--379.png--><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a><span class="pageno">343</span>
resolve to embrace the conclusions of his theories to their
fullest legitimate extent? While the writings of the new
divines seem to represent their theories as perfectly formed,
and their views quite fixed, the extracts we have just made
show them to be but the shifting and unsettled opinions of
men who are yet discovering errors in what they have formerly
believed, and seeking further evidence of what they shall
henceforth hold. Our concluding extract shall give fuller
evidence of this fact: it is a letter to Mr. Newman, dated
All Saints’ Day, 1835. “Before I finish this, I must enter
another protest against your cursing and swearing at the end
of the [Via Media] as you do. What good can it do? And
I call it uncharitable to an excess. How mistaken we may
ourselves be, on many points that are only gradually opening
on us! Surely, you should reserve ‘blasphemous,’ ‘impious,’
etc., for denial of the articles of Faith.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_369" id="fnanchor_369"></a><a href="#footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>‘With this passage we close Mr. Froude’s <cite>Remains</cite>. Peace
be to him! is our parting salutation. The hope which an
Ambrose expressed for a Valentinian,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_370" id="fnanchor_370"></a><a href="#footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></span> who died yet a Catechumen,
we willingly will hold of him. His ardent desires were
with the Truth; his heart was not a stranger to its love. He
was one, we firmly believe, whom no sordid views, or fear of
men’s tongues, would have deterred from avowing his full
convictions, and embracing their consequences, had time and
opportunity been vouchsafed him for a longer and closer
search. He is another instance of the same mysterious Providence
which guided a Grotius and a Leibnitz to the threshold
of Truth, but allowed them not the time to step within it,
into the hallowed precincts of God’s Visible Church.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_371" id="fnanchor_371"></a><a href="#footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></span></p>

From ‘<span class="smcap">The Anglican Career of Cardinal Newman</span>,’ by
<span class="smcap">Edwin A. Abbott</span>. London: Macmillan &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, 1892.</p>

<p class="center small">[By the kind permission of Dr. Abbott and of Messrs. Macmillan &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>]</p>

<p>‘Newman was now [1826] on the point of making a new
friend who would do more than any other human being,
perhaps more than any other single external influence, to
direct his course, or to determine its final direction. “Bye-the-bye,”
says Newman to his mother, telling her of the election to
the Oriel Fellowship, March 31, 1826, “I have not told you
the name of the other successful candidate: Froude of Oriel.
We were in grave deliberation till near two this morning….
Froude is one of the acutest and clearest and deepest men in
the memory of man.” Clearly, Froude had had, not only
Newman’s vote, but also his strenuous advocacy in that prolonged
deliberation. And it was no bad preparation for the
reception of Froude’s influence into Newman’s heart, that the
latter should thus have favoured and befriended him….
What took Newman, in Froude, was his originality and
suggestiveness, his hatred of shams, his downright and aggressive
earnestness, and perhaps, too, some glimpse of what was afterwards
revealed in him: an anxious, ascetic, and almost superstitious
aspiration after a mediæval type of holiness…. There
were walks that Froude tells us of, in which the two talked a
good deal together. Froude complains that he allowed himself
to say to Newman more than he intended, revealed too much,
<!--381.png--><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a><span class="pageno">345</span>
suffered himself to be drawn into argument, and was puzzled
… but if the older beat the younger in argument, that would
rather help than hinder the influence of the latter. Expert
in logical fence, Newman could not help gaining victories
which he disdained as soon as won; but Froude was effective
in protests, and all the more with one who, most vulnerable
when victorious, had just achieved a dialectical triumph.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘… To get at Newman, a friend had to appeal to him
through the imagination; … indeed, one of the friends whom
we shall have before us, did actually, though indirectly,
influence Newman’s action at so many points in his career that
if we omitted a sketch of him here, we should have to be
constantly digressing for explanations afterwards. The three
friends are: Edward Bouverie Pusey, John Keble, and, as a
climax in respect of influence, Richard Hurrell Froude….
Froude’s opinions, [Newman] says, arrested him, even when
they did not gain his consent…. In all these beliefs
[enumerated in the <cite>Apologia</cite>] Froude certainly preceded, and
evidence will hereafter clearly prove that he also led, the friend
who had been gradually disengaging himself from the
Evangelical School. Even in other matters where, at first,
Newman and he differed, Newman, in the end, came round to
him. Froude was “powerfully drawn to the Mediæval Church,”
Newman to the Primitive; but the Mediæval finally triumphed.
He set no great store on theological detail, nor on the writings
of the Fathers, but “took an eager courageous view of things as
a whole.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_372" id="fnanchor_372"></a><a href="#footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></span> Omit “courageous,” perhaps also the “eager,” and the
sentence will describe the nature of Newman’s final decision.
He, too, took “things as a whole”: it was the personified
majesty of the vision of Rome that ultimately took him captive.
Recognising the difficulty of enumerating all the additions to
his creed which Newman derived from a friend to whom he
owed so much, the <cite>Apologia</cite> selects four: admiration for Rome,
dislike of the Reformation, devotion to the Blessed Virgin,
belief in the Real Presence. But there is perhaps not one in
the long list of Froude’s other opinions [on sacerdotal power,
ecclesiastical liberty, acceptance of tradition, the intrinsic
<!--382.png--><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a><span class="pageno">346</span>
excellence of virginity, miraculous interferences, delight in the
Saints, and the principle of penance and mortification: see the
passage in the <cite>Apologia</cite>] in which his influence on Newman
is not perceptible. If not first planted, some of them were at
all events “fixed deep,” and firmly rooted, by the friend who
had previously received them. If, therefore, we would understand
Newman’s development, we should spare no trouble in
attempting to understand that one of all his friends who is
shown by evidence, direct and indirect, to have contributed
most to it. For this purpose all the more pains are needed,
because the very friends who loved him best dealt somewhat
hardly with his reputation. In his literary <cite>Remains</cite>, they gave
to the world the most secret records of his private life, in which,
besides hinting at deeper “vilenesses,” he sets down in detail,
with unflinching severity, if not with exaggeration, the very
smallest infirmities of will and deed. The <cite>Apologia</cite> speaks of
“the gentleness and tenderness of nature, the playfulness, the
free elastic force and graceful versatility of mind, and the
patient winning considerateness in discussion which endeared
him to those to whom he opened his heart”; and other testimony
enables us to believe that in the small circle of those
who knew him well, he was really such as he is there described;
but if we are to judge from his <cite>Remains</cite>, it is a question
whether this gentleness and considerateness reached far beyond
the close company of those who were struggling for the
religious cause which he had at heart.</p>

<p>‘… The Journal begins in the year 1826, when he was
elected to the Oriel Fellowship. The second line is as follows:
“<abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 1, Oxford. All my associations here are bad, and
I can hardly shake them off.” He determines to wrestle with
his conceit, affectation, wandering of mind, lassitude….
Then follows an allusion which Newman, devoted by a kind of
inward vow to celibacy since the age of sixteen, would well
understand: “The consciousness of having capacities for
happiness, with no objects to gratify them, seems to grow upon
me. Lord, have mercy upon me.” This is the mood which
he elsewhere describes to Newman as “sawney”: natural at
times to those who are under a kind of vow to serve a cause,
without domestic distractions or encumbrances.</p>

<p><!--383.png--><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a><span class="pageno">347</span>
‘The problem exhibited in these pages … is the old but never
antiquated one: “How to keep the human machine in order.”
Roughly speaking, we may say that there are two solutions.
Men can be delivered from the beast within them by love, or
by fear. The second may be called no deliverance at all by
those who have a keen appreciation of the first, but it is
deliverance, of a sort; and Froude’s Journal shows us a man
of immense strength of will: of acute intellect, and of high
imaginations; restless and masterful almost to the extent of
tyrannical malignity, in his youth; conscious of grievous lapses
in the past and of something (he hardly knew what) terribly
wanting in his present moral condition; now at last goaded
by bitter remorse, and urged by the pressure of new responsibilities,
to reform his corrupt nature, and attempting to work
out his salvation through an asceticism dictated, at first, by
something like terror…. In 1826, Froude had sent a letter
to Keble, curiously tingeing with his own gloom the language
of the Psalmist, who prays to be hidden under the “shadow of
the wings” of the divine Protection: he speaks of God as a
Being whose presence is mainly manifested by control, and by
a holy “terror”:</p>

<div class="poem-container no-break">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">‘“Lord of the World, Almighty King!</div>
  <div class="i0">Thy shadow resteth over all,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or where the Saints thy terrors sing,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or where the waves obey Thy call.”</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>‘… Froude’s religion, then, so far as it depended upon
his conception of God, was a religion of almost unmixed fear.
So far as it was of something better, it was purified, first, by
a love and admiration for “the holy men of old,” such as the
founders of the Oxford Colleges, in whose steps, after his
election to his Fellowship, he aspired to tread; secondly, by
his affection for Keble, for whom, in the prayer written at the
same time, he thanks God, as one who had convinced him of
the error of his ways, and in whose presence he tasted happiness;
but above all, by his devotion to his mother, in whose
recollection he found a consciousness of that blessedness which
he had been taught to look for in the presence of Saints and
Angels. These were feelings which were better than his religion,
and which, if they could have developed and grown with the
<!--384.png--><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a><span class="pageno">348</span>
latter, might have delivered it from fears, and have converted
it into a source of peace as well as of activity: but whether
from the irremediable taint of the past, or owing to influence
that proved too strong for Keble’s, this growth did not go on.</p>

<p>‘Newman … taught at an early period that self-knowledge
is the basis of all religious knowledge. Whether Froude
adopted or originated this doctrine, it must have stimulated his
fears: for it was a proverb with him that “everyone may know
worse of himself than he possibly can of Charles the Second.”
In less than six months after the thanksgiving recorded above,
we find him protesting (January 10, 1827) that he dares not
now utter the prayers of wise and holy men, and that God has
affrighted him with hideous dreams, and disquieted him with
perpetual mortifications…. It is to Keble that he owes
his release, for how long he knows not, from the misery in
which he has been recently bound. At the same time Keble
advises him to give up his ascetic self-denial, and Froude
acquiesces. Though it had the colour of humility, it now
appears to him to have been in reality the food of pride:
self-imposed, it seems to him “quite different from imposed
by the Church.” What sort of self-denials they were, and
what Froude’s self-introspection implied, the reader ought to
be informed for two reasons: first, because they show the
fierce determination and almost bitter self-hatred with which
the young man turned against himself, in his resolution to
suppress his own egotism and conceit; and secondly, because
Newman and Keble (or perhaps Keble instigated by Newman),
thought it worth while to record the minutest of these details,
and spoke of the Journal as a most valuable contribution to
Tractarian literature. Froude sets down, for example, (and
they print!) that he was ashamed, on one occasion, to have
it known that he had no gloves; that he was ashamed, on
another, that he had muddy trousers (although he would not go
to the length of concealing them); that he was pleased, on
another, when there was no Evening Prayer; that he felt an
impulse of pleasure on finding that W. was not at Chapel one
morning; that he ostentatiously hinted to S. that he got up
at six o’clock; that he read affectedly in evening Chapel;
that he felt an inclination to make remarks with a view to
<!--385.png--><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a><span class="pageno">349</span>
showing how much he had thought upon serious subjects;
and that once, after accidentally breaking one of W.’s
windows, he felt a disposition to “sneak away.” … He
seriously argues the pros and cons (“bothering” himself about
it for three days), concerning the purchase of a great-coat.
On the one side, there is the fact that he “wants,” <i>i.e.</i>, needs
it, which one would have thought would have been conclusive;
but against this he sets the fact that he “wishes” it; and
therefore it will be well to deny himself the satisfaction….
By his own confession, he occasionally made himself stupid
and sleepy through his ascetic habits. But to the last he
retained his admiration for them, at all events when they were
imposed by external authority….</p>

<p>‘Why did the Editors of Froude’s <cite>Remains</cite> give to the world
these extraordinary confessions?… If, indeed, Froude had
taken Keble’s advice, they could not thus have made his secrets
the property of posterity; for he had advised his pupil not only
to give up his self-imposed asceticisms, but also to burn his
confessions. But this advice was given in 1826; whereas the
<cite>Remains</cite> were published in 1838. Are we wrong in inferring
that during this interval, Keble may have been pushed forward
by Newman his Co-editor, who taught that all religious knowledge
must be based on self-knowledge? From the Letters,
this seems probable…. It follows, at once, that there is
very little thankfulness in Froude’s form of Christianity.
The visible world seemed so full of delusion, mockery, and
temptation, that a hostile or ironical attitude towards it was the
only one possible. “This irony,” says James Mozley, “arose
from that peculiar mode in which Froude viewed all earthly
things, himself and all that was dear to him not excepted.”
What was this peculiar mode? To define it briefly would
be difficult. It must have recognised something of reality
and goodness in those friends and allies towards whom his
heart went out, and with whom he was ready to labour, to
the end, for what he considered the “Truth,” freely placing
his fortune, his faculties, and his last breath, at their disposal.
But still, it was not the “mode” of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul, nor of
Keble; it was more like, though not quite like, that of
Newman. It was certainly not the “mode” of the author
<!--386.png--><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a><span class="pageno">350</span>
who wrote that “God giveth us all things richly to enjoy.”
Indeed, “irony” is perhaps hardly the right word to use
of the superficial self-mockery, but more profound self-hatred
and self-contempt, approaching sometimes to despair,
with which, in some of his self-introspective moods, Froude
smites and rends himself, and his faults; yes, and his resolves
to correct his faults, sometimes even pouring scorn upon
himself for writing down his own good resolutions, and for
thinking well of himself, in the act of doing it. “The chief
reason,” he says, “for my being interested in any object, is the
fact that I happen to be pursuing it,” “nor can I look with
serious feeling on the miseries of anyone but my own. The
blight of God is on me for my selfish life.” … Is “irony”
a term quite strong enough to denote this savage, sarcastic
self-laceration, which, if persisted in, would result in moral
and spiritual suicide? So far, it would seem that the two
friends resembled each other in almost every one of their
principles of religious thought. A religion of fear; a profound
sense of an awful Holiness; an absence of general loving-kindness
and human-heartedness; a vast and almost servile
respect for power as power; an inclination to asceticism, in the
older of the two as a test of sincerity, but in the younger, rather
as a means of suppressing the passions; a dread of wilfulness,
and a rooted suspicion of self,&mdash;these feelings appear to have
been, in both, so powerful and original, that whatever influence
either might exert upon the other would result, not in changing,
but in confirming and hardening; or at most, in suggesting
some new application of the theories common to both.</p>

<p>‘We now pass to the only principle in which the two
seem first to have differed, but ultimately to have agreed.
This principle (if it may be so called) is that of tact or
management, especially in the diffusion, colouring, and sometimes
in the reservation or suppression, of religious doctrine,
with a view to surmounting prejudice and instilling truth.
To this, Newman (though not the first to use the word in
this sense) gave the name of “economy.” There are many
reasons for concluding that in this one respect Froude was
passive, a simple recipient from Newman…. Froude anticipated,
and endeavoured to develop precipitately, the logical
<!--387.png--><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a><span class="pageno">351</span>
results, both of the principles which they held in common, and
of those which he instilled into his friend, and also of this particular
principle which alone his friend seems to have instilled
into him. Such a development may be often noticed, when a
strong-willed man who sees only one side of a question, takes
up a plan invented by another who sees many. The inventor
may be moderate; the adopter carries the invention to excess.
Froude was at that time (1834) dragging Newman onwards
towards Roman doctrine; but he may have submitted to learn
from Newman the best method of diffusing it. He did not
like the method, and therefore he called it by bad names, such
as “undermining,” “poisoning,” and the like….</p>

<p>‘Newman’s formal usual doctrine [was] that as we cannot
be sure about our own salvation, so neither can we about that
of others; that we have enough to do with thinking and fearing
about our own eternal concerns; that, as before God, no man
can help another, for we must not only die alone but live alone,
nor can there be any spiritual contact between soul and soul,
in this life. Yet at least on one occasion his feelings were
too strong for his dogma. When Froude drew near to death,
Newman refused to fear for his sake. With him in his mind,
he would not use his favourite metaphor of “grovelling worms,”
to describe the relation between the human and the divine.
Casting away all reserve, all doubts, and all terrors, he shoots
up to a Miltonic height, in the confidence that God cannot
waste this immortal soul which He has made. Thus he writes
to Froude himself:</p>

<p>‘“It made me think how many posts there are in His
kingdom, how many offices, Who says to one Do this, and he
doeth it. It is quite impossible that, some way or other, you
are not destined to be the instrument of God’s purposes.
Though I saw the earth cleave and you fall in, or Heaven
open and a chariot appear, I should say just the same. God
has ten thousand posts of service. You might be of use in
the central elemental fire; you might be of use in the depths
of the sea.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_373" id="fnanchor_373"></a><a href="#footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>‘The same passionate conviction, based not upon Authority
or upon Scripture, but upon his own sense of what must be
<!--388.png--><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a><span class="pageno">352</span>
right, finds expression also in a sermon written about the
same time.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_374" id="fnanchor_374"></a><a href="#footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>‘“They are taken away for some purpose, surely; their
gifts are not lost to us: their soaring minds, the fire of their
contemplations, the sanctity of their desires, the vigour of
their faith, the sweetness and gentleness of their affections,
were not given without an object. Yea, doubtless they are
keeping up the perpetual chant in the Shrine above, praying
and praising God day and night in His Temple like Moses
upon the mount, while Joshua and his host fight with
Amalek.”</p>

<p>‘… Deprived of Froude, and now of his mother, with one
sister married, and the other to be married a few months afterwards,
Newman must have felt alone indeed. How much this
feeling of communion with the departed had been growing in
Newman may be seen from the only two poems of 1835<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_375" id="fnanchor_375"></a><a href="#footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></span> (the
last until we come to the Roman period), both of which bring
before us the intercession of the dead for the living. There
can be no doubt whose voice Newman was henceforth to hear
most distinctly amid all the earthly din and uproar of the
conflict of the <cite>Tracts</cite>: it was that of the man whose Breviary
(assigned to him by a chance utterance of some friend, which
he accepted as a message from Heaven) lay always on his
study table, destined to lie there for half a century; to the
possession of which he attached such importance, that besides
minutely describing the incident in the <cite>Apologia</cite>, he records it
in the <cite>Letters</cite>, along with his mother’s death, as one of nine
important events of this critical year: “My knowing and using
the Breviary.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_376" id="fnanchor_376"></a><a href="#footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Froude (not Froude’s opinions, but Froude himself, or
his personality, Froude first, living, and then, as a posthumous
influence, still more powerful after death), did more
than any other external thing to make Newman what he
became, and to shape, through Newman, the Tractarian Movement.
Some of Newman’s most important steps dated from
the year of their intimacy. It was in 1829 that the two
<!--389.png--><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a><span class="pageno">353</span>
became close friends: Newman the non-political, and Froude
the High Tory…. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A priori</i>, we ought to be prepared to
believe that Froude pushed Newman on. Froude was a High
Churchman from the first, with an inclination towards the
Mediæval Church, and from this he never swerved: Newman
was an Evangelical, extricating himself from Evangelicalism.
The former had no doubts; the latter was at that time perpetually
doubting. How could it be otherwise than natural
that the former should take the lead of the latter?</p>

<p>‘… Froude is not quite fairly, or at least fully, represented
in the <cite>Remains</cite>. The Journal, and even the Letters,
fail, perhaps, to express some latent feeling which might have
softened apparent harshness. To those who knew him well,
his words were interpreted by his personality, which all concur
in describing as bright, graceful, and even “beautiful.” … It
was this brilliant and graceful embodiment, in one so earnest,
so ascetically strict, so clear-headed, and so confident, [one] of
definite consistent imaginations about spiritual things (which
imaginations Newman describes as “intellectual principles”)
that first arrested, and ultimately captivated the older friend,
who was at first disposed to smile at, even while admiring, the
erratic, “sillyish,” “red-hot” High Churchman….</p>

<p>‘… Fundamentally agreeing with Froude, from the first,
in the principles of religious fear, obedience, and self-distrust,
Newman differed from him only in the expression and application
of them; and on these points Froude’s mind was settled
while Newman’s was still in flux. No wonder that, by degrees,
Newman lost confidence in any utterance of his own unless
Froude first stamped it with his approval. Did not Froude
always take the lead, experimenting, as it were, on himself?
And had not Newman repeatedly to confess that Froude
was right, and he himself wrong? One reason for this was,
that Froude, being of an æsthetic bent, instinctively turned
from the Primitive Church, which was, to him, an affair of
books, and of which he knew very little, to the Mediæval
Church, with which he was in complete harmony, or to the
Anglican Nonjurors, about whom he had some sympathetic
knowledge. This gave to his notions a naturalness and a
practicableness in which Newman’s were deficient. For this,
<!--390.png--><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a><span class="pageno">354</span>
and for other reasons, Froude seemed to be a seer in regions
where Newman was only a groper; and so, in time, the latter
came naturally not only to depend on the former, but also to
avow his dependence so far as to declare his unwillingness to
commit himself to anything definite till the man who could
see had given it his imprimatur. Still, the brighter and more
pleasing side of Froude’s character must not allow us to forget
that his search after holiness implied not only something
bordering on abjectness towards God, but also strife on earth,
and the appearance of ill-will towards a great multitude of
men. These qualities explain in part the secret of his power
over Newman, who would not have allowed himself to be influenced
by any but a detached soul holding aloof from all
the world, and especially, perhaps, from the rabble, that
“knoweth not the law.” But Froude was by far the more
combative of the two, and appears to have acted on Newman,
as on Keble, in the way of an inciting cause, or, to use his
own metaphor, a “poker.”</p>

<p>‘We find here depicted [in the <cite>Remains</cite>] a Christian in
whose most secret records, self-examinations and prayers, there
appears scarcely any mention of Christ as a Person, and very
little trace of any love of Christ (who hardly appears at all in
them except in some reference to the sacramental Body and
Blood); yet one who with all his heart and soul is seeking
after that salvation which he supposes to be derivable from
Christ’s Church; a man who obstinately detested, first in himself,
then in others, the least vestige of affectation, cant, and
hypocrisy: who spoke what he meant, as he meant it, and
would always have gone, if his friends had allowed him, by
the straightest of ways towards what he deemed the best of
objects; a man, therefore, of an essentially truth-loving disposition,
searching for Truth in all sincerity, but restricted by a
“system” to a search within certain limits and through certain
methods; shut out from the great world of men, and shut into
the comparatively small world&mdash;not indeed, as Newman was,
of books, but&mdash;of ecclesiastical traditions and imaginations;
by nature, without any deep feeling of human-hearted sociality,
without love of man as a fellow-man; by ecclesiasticism led
rather to hate than to love; loving indeed a few, but only as a
<!--391.png--><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a><span class="pageno">355</span>
Spartan might love his companions-in-arms, loving those select
spirits by whose side he could battle for the interests of “the
Church.”</p>

<p>‘Such a picture, though “instructive,” is not pleasing. Yet
those who feel inclined to ridicule, or to give way to disgust,
as they peruse records of one whom they may be disposed to
call the Minute Ascetic,&mdash;telling us of his shame at feeling
ashamed that he had muddy trousers, or no gloves, or of his
remorse for talking “flash,” or for not finding it easy to keep
awake during a sermon, or for wanting to win sixpences at
cards, will, if they read a little further, generally find other
entries of a different character, as, for example, touching a
certain offertory: “Intended £2: 10s., but thought I should be
observed, so vowed £5 to the &mdash;&mdash; Mendicity Society.” We
cannot smile at the man who, beneath under-statements conveyed
half in slang, half in the language of Tractarian reserve, concealed
a resolution not only to deny himself, but even, so far as he
could, to suppress himself; who so hated his own individuality,
and was so alarmed at the least touch of the self-will of genius
within him, that he made it his “great ambition to become a
humdrum.” Doomed to an early lingering death, and to leave
others to continue the religious conflict in which he, of all the
combatants, took the keenest and most passionate pleasure,
he drops no word of self-commiseration and repining; and in
the last month of his life, having contributed the proceeds of
his Fellowship to the cause, he asks Newman to use it at his
pleasure, and to make people infer that the money was being
contributed by a large number of subscribers. “Spend away,
my boy, and make a great fuss, as if your money came from
a variety of sources.” If this was “economy,” it cannot, at all
events, be scoffed at. Nothing is here for contempt, least of
all from commonplace, compromising, half-way-halting semi-Christians
or quasi-Christians. Manifestly, we have here a
man: no mere word-bag or lump of sensations, but a being
with a will, and with a controlling purpose; one who knew his
own mind, and therefore had a right to lead those who did not
know theirs; a fine specimen of the ecclesiastic militant, essentially
a champion of holiness, though essentially, if charity be
essential, not a Christian. Such was Richard Hurrell Froude,
<!--392.png--><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a><span class="pageno">356</span>
who, while living, influenced Newman much, and after his
death, more; “re-touching the faith,” and “deepening every line,”
not as Newman’s poem suggested, of himself, but of the poet,
his survivor, his second self. When [Froude] died, a book of
his, by what most people would call an accident, passed into
Newman’s possession. Newman deemed it more than an
accident. From that time forward it lay on his study table;
and by it, though dead, his friend continued to speak to and to
guide him: always in one direction. Rightly does Newman
record as one among nine important events of the “cardinal”
spring of 1836, “my knowing and using the Breviary.”’</p>

<p>‘The chief aim of the Fellowship [at Oriel] was to test
dialectical power; a chief occupation of the Common Room
was to practise it…. Newman himself, who did more than
any other man to divert the College from criticism to submission,
has left a vivid picture … of his own argumentative
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brusquerie</i> in the congenial atmosphere of the Oriel Common
Room. And it is noticeable, both in his case and that of
Richard Hurrell Froude, his chief coadjutor in sowing the seed
of the coming Tractarianism in College, that their method was
essentially dialectic and modern, even though its effect, on themselves
and others, was to lead them into “fierce thoughts” against
the modern spirit and the modern trend of things. Pusey
might bury himself in theology, and Keble might be the
singer and sweet saint of a revived devotion; but Newman
and Froude, even when the gates of authority seemed about to
close on them for ever, were questioners and controversialists
and gladiators, striving to rationalise reason out of its own
supremacy.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘In hurrying on the birth of the new issue, both at Oriel
and beyond it, the influence of Richard Hurrell Froude was very
great. We have seen that he was elected a Fellow of Oriel in
<!--393.png--><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a><span class="pageno">357</span>
1826. He was an Oriel man throughout, and had taken a
double second in 1824. He was the eldest son of the Archdeacon
of Totnes, and the eldest of three eminent brothers,
all Oriel men: William, the engineer, born in 1810, and
James Anthony, the historian, born in 1818. Hurrell was
born in 1803. Always delicate, he fell into consumption early
in the Thirties, and died in 1836. But though his career was
short and enfeebled, and though there is little of him in print
but what the affectionate appreciation of his friends put there,
it is certain that Hurrell Froude had in his College an influence
both intense and peculiar, which radiated widely, and was
answerable for some of the most marked phenomena of
Tractarianism. Froude was perhaps the most convinced,
the most outspoken, the most throughgoing Mediævalist
among the young men who thought the Church of England
in an unsatisfactory condition; and he had the incommunicable
and inexplicable gift of great personal influence, which, in his
case, took the most irresistible of all its forms: that of impressing
others with his equal pre-eminence in intellect and
character. While the other Tractarian propagandists of the
immediate future were recoiling in fear and anxiety from the
advance of the Liberal and Erastian tide, Froude was ardently
counselling reaction, loudly and scornfully proclaiming the
loveliness and rightness of at least a large number of Roman
opinions and practices, and laying a zealous axe at the root of
the Protestantism of the Church of England.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘In fact, one can plainly see that the religious revival which
was coming to the English Church was the real cause of the
tutorial quarrel at Oriel in 1830. The Tutors had the new
wine of it in their veins; they were the subjects of an
enthusiasm which they were impelled to communicate, and
which was intolerant of restraint; whilst the Provost [Hawkins]
was, and was to remain, outside the range of the new ideas.
In such a situation compromise was impracticable…. This
change had certain important and well-marked results on the
College. In the first place, it riveted the authority of Provost
Hawkins, and made him for the rest of his life the dominant
force in Oriel. In the second place, as the deprived Tutors
<!--394.png--><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a><span class="pageno">358</span>
remained Fellows and attached members of the College, it did
nothing to reduce the spread of their influence in Common
Room, and indirectly, in College generally, but rather tended
to increase it, by opposition. Lastly, and most important of all,
it dealt a blow to the intellectual prestige of the College, from
which it never recovered during Hawkins’s long reign.’</p>

<p class="center small">[By the kind permission of Miss Froude and of Messrs. Longmans.]</p>

<p>‘… The last forty or fifty years will be memorable
hereafter in the history of English opinion. The number of
those who recollect the beginnings of the Oxford Revival is
shrinking fast; and such of us as survive may usefully note
down their personal recollections as a contribution, so far as it
goes, to the general narrative. It is pleasant, too, to recall the
figures of those who played the chief parts in the drama. If
they had not been men of ability, they could not have produced
the revolution that was brought about by them. Their
personal characters were singularly interesting. Two of them
were distinctly men of real genius. My own brother was, at
starting, the foremost of the party; the flame, therefore,
naturally burnt hot in my own immediate environment. The
phrases and formulas of Anglo-Catholicism had become household
words in our family, before I understood coherently what
the stir and tumult was about.</p>

<p>‘We fancy that we are free agents. We are conscious of
what we do; we are not conscious of the causes which
make us do it; and therefore we imagine that the cause is in
ourselves. The Oxford leaders believed that they were fighting
against the spirit of the age. They were themselves most
completely the creatures of their age. It was one of those
periods when conservative England had been seized with
a passion for reform. Parliament was to be reformed; the
municipal institutions were to be reformed; there was to be an
<!--395.png--><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a><span class="pageno">359</span>
end of monopolies and privileges. The Constitution was to
be cut in pieces and boiled in the Benthamite caldron, from
which it was to emerge in immortal youth. In a reformed
State there needed a reformed Church. My brother and his
friends abhorred Bentham and all his works. The Establishment,
in its existing state, was too weak to do battle with the
new enemy. Protestantism was the chrysalis of Liberalism.
The Church, therefore, was to be unprotestantised. The Reformation,
my brother said, “was a bad setting of a broken limb.”
The limb needed breaking a second time, and then it would
be equal to its business.</p>

<p>‘My brother exaggerated the danger, and underestimated
the strength, which existing institutions and customs possess,
so long as they are left undisturbed. Before he and his
friends undertook the process of reconstruction, the Church
was perhaps in the healthiest condition which it had ever
known…. The average English incumbent of fifty years ago
was a man of private fortune, the younger brother of the landlord
perhaps, and holding the family living; or it might be
the landlord himself, his advowson being part of the estate.
His professional duties were his services on Sunday, funerals
and weddings on week-days, and visits, when needed, among
the sick. In other respects he lived like his neighbours,
distinguished from them only by a black coat and white neckcloth,
and greater watchfulness over his words and actions.
He farmed his own glebe; he kept horses; he shot and hunted
moderately, and mixed in general society. He was generally
a magistrate; he attended public meetings, and his education
enabled him to take a leading part in county business. His
wife and daughters looked after the poor, taught in the Sunday
school, and managed the penny clubs and clothing clubs.
He himself was spoken of in the parish as “the master,” the
person who was responsible for keeping order there, and who
knew how to keep it. The labourers and the farmers looked
up to him. The family in the “great house” could not look
down upon him. If he was poor, it was still his pride to bring
up his sons as gentlemen; and economies were cheerfully
submitted to at home to give them a start in life at the
University, or in the Army or Navy.</p>

<p><!--396.png--><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a><span class="pageno">360</span>
‘Our own household was a fair representative of the order.
My father was Rector of the parish. He was Archdeacon,
he was Justice of the Peace. He had a moderate fortune of
his own, consisting chiefly in land, and he belonged, therefore,
to the “landed interest.” Most of the magistrates’ work of the
neighbourhood passed through his hands. If anything was
amiss, it was his advice which was most sought after; and I
remember his being called upon to lay a troublesome ghost.
In his younger days, he had been a hard rider across country.
His children knew him as a continually busy, useful man of
the world, a learned and cultivated antiquary, and an accomplished
artist. My brothers and I were excellently educated,
and were sent to School and College. Our spiritual lessons
did not go beyond the Catechism. We were told that our
business in life was to work, and to make an honourable
position for ourselves. About doctrine, Evangelical or
Catholic, I do not think that in my early boyhood I ever
heard a single word, in Church or out of it. The institution
had drifted into the condition of what I should call moral
health. It did not instruct us in mysteries, it did not teach
us to make religion a special object of our thoughts; it taught
us to use religion as a light by which to see our way along
the road of duty. Without the sun, our eyes would be of no
use to us; but if we look <em>at</em> the sun we are simply dazzled,
and can see neither it nor anything else. It is precisely the
same with theological speculations. If the beacon lamp is
shining, a man of healthy mind will not discuss the composition
of the flame. Enough if it shows him how to steer, and
keep clear of shoals and breakers. To this conception of the
thing we had practically arrived. Doctrinal controversies were
sleeping. People went to Church because they liked it, because
they knew that they ought to go, and because it was the custom.
They had received the Creeds from their fathers, and doubts
about them had never crossed their minds. Christianity had
wrought itself into the constitution of their natures. It was a
necessary part of the existing order of the universe, as little to
be debated about as the movements of the planets or the
changes of the seasons.</p>

<p>‘Such the Church of England was, in the country districts,
<!--397.png--><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a><span class="pageno">361</span>
before the Tractarian Movement. It was not perfect, but it
was doing its work satisfactorily. It is easier to alter than to
improve, and the beginning of change, like the beginning of
strife, is like the letting out of water. Jupiter, in Lessing’s
fable, was invited to mend a fault in human nature. The
fault was not denied, but Jupiter said that man was a piece
of complicated machinery, and if he touched a part he might
probably spoil the whole.</p>

<p>‘But a new era was upon us. The miraculous nineteenth
century was coming of age, and all the world was to be remade….
History was reconstructed for us. I had learned, like other
Protestant children, that the Pope was Antichrist, and that
Gregory <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr></span> had been a special revelation of that being. I
was now taught that Gregory <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr></span> was a Saint. I had been
told to honour the Reformers. The Reformation became the
Great Schism, Cranmer a traitor, and Latimer a vulgar ranter.
Milton was a name of horror, and Charles <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="One">I.</abbr></span> was canonised and
spoken of as the holy and blessed Martyr <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Charles. I asked
once whether the Church of England was able properly to
create a Saint? <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Charles was immediately pointed out to
me. Similarly, we were to admire the Nonjurors, to speak of
James <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></span> instead of The Pretender; to look for Antichrist,
not in the Pope, but in Whigs and revolutionists and all their
works. Henry of Exeter,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_377" id="fnanchor_377"></a><a href="#footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></span> so famous in those days, announced
once, in my hearing, that the Court of Rome had regretted the
Emancipation Act as a victory of Latitudinarianism. I suppose
he believed what he was saying….</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘These were the views which we used to hear in our home-circle,
when the Tracts were first beginning. We had been
bred, all of us, Tories of the old school. This was Toryism in
ecclesiastical costume. My brother was young, gifted, brilliant,
and enthusiastic. No man is ever good for much who has not
been carried off his feet by enthusiasm, between twenty and
thirty; but it needs to be bridled and bitted; and my brother
did not live to be taught the difference between fact and speculation.
Taught it he would have been, if time had been
allowed him. No one ever recognised facts more loyally than
<!--398.png--><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a><span class="pageno">362</span>
he, when once he saw them. This I am sure of, that when
the intricacies of the situation pressed upon him, when it
became clear to him that if his conception of the Church, and
of its rights and position, was true at all, it was not true of
the Church of England in which he was born, and that he
must renounce his theory as visionary or join another Communion,
he would not have “minimised” the Roman doctrines
that they might be more easy for him to swallow, or have
explained away plain propositions till they meant anything
or nothing. Whether he would have swallowed them, or not,
I cannot say; I was not eighteen when he died, and I do not
so much as form an opinion about it; but his course, whatever
it was, would have been direct and straightforward; he was a
man far more than a theologian: and if he had gone, he would
have gone with his whole heart and conscience, unassisted by
subtleties and nice distinctions. It is, however, at least equally
possible that he would not have gone at all….</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘The terminus, however, towards which he and his friends
were moving, had not come in sight in my brother’s lifetime.
He went forward, hesitating at nothing, taking the fences as
they came, passing lightly over them all, and sweeping his
friends along with him. He had the contempt of an intellectual
aristocrat for private judgement and the rights of a man.
In common things, a person was a fool who preferred his own
judgement to that of an expert. Why, he asked, should it be
wiser to follow private judgement in religion? As to rights,
the right of wisdom was to rule, and the right of ignorance was
to be ruled. But he belonged himself to the class whose
business was to order rather than obey. If his own Bishop
had interfered with him, his theory of episcopal authority
would have been found inapplicable in that particular
instance.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘… The triumvirs who became a national force, and gave
its real character to the Oxford Movement, were Keble, Pusey,
and John Henry Newman. Newman himself was the moving
power; the two others were powers also, but of inferior mental
strength. Without the third, they would have been known as
<!--399.png--><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a><span class="pageno">363</span>
men of genius and learning; but their personal influence would
have been limited to and have ended with themselves. Of
Pusey I knew but little, and need not do more than mention
him. Of Keble I can only venture to say a few words….
The inability to appreciate the force of arguments which he
did not like saved him from Rome, but did not save him
from Roman doctrine. It would, perhaps, have been better if
he had left the Church of England, instead of remaining there
to shelter behind his high authority a revolution in its teaching.
The Mass has crept back among us, with which we thought
we had done for ever, and the honourable name of Protestant,
once our proudest distinction, has been made over to the
Church of Scotland and the Dissenters.</p>

<p>‘Far different from Keble, from my brother, from Dr. Pusey,
from all the rest, was the true chief of the Catholic revival&mdash;John
Henry Newman. Compared with him, they were all but
as ciphers, and he the indicating number.’</p>

<p>‘… Mr. Froude, in his present attempt to paint the picture
of the great men of the twelfth century, puts on the outward
garb of one who has read and tested his materials, and has
come to a critical judgement on what he has read and tested.
But he happily leaves a little cranny open which enables us to
look within. The very first words of Mr. Froude’s <cite>Life and
Times of Thomas Becket</cite> are enough to show us that the
<!--400.png--><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a><span class="pageno">364</span>
seeming historical inquiry is really designed as a manifesto
against a theological party which once numbered its author
among its members. To those who know the whole literature
of the subject, it has a look more unpleasant still. Those
whose study of twelfth-century history goes back to times when
those who are now in their second half-century were young,
will not fail to remember a time when the name of Froude
reminded them of another, an earlier, and (I have no hesitation
in saying) a worthier treatment of the same subject. And
some of those who go back so far may be tempted to
think that natural kindliness, if no other feeling, might have
kept back the fiercest of partisans from ignoring the honest
work of a long-deceased brother, and from dealing stabs in
the dark at a brother’s almost forgotten fame…. [Mr.
Froude] is controversial, something more than controversial,
from the beginning. He undertakes the study, not to throw
fresh light on the history of the twelfth century, but to deal a
blow at a party in the nineteenth. His first words are:
“Among the earliest efforts of the modern sacerdotal party in
the Church of England was an attempt to re-establish the
memory of the Martyr of Canterbury.” It is not everybody
who reads this who will fully take in what is here meant.
The first attempt made, within the memory of our own
generation, to examine and compare the materials for the
great controversy between King and Primate, was made by
Richard Hurrell Froude of Oriel College: the Froude of the
once famous <cite>Remains</cite>, the elder brother of the man who makes
this somewhat unbrotherly reference. The elder Froude
doubtless belonged to what the younger calls “the sacerdotal
party.” His wish undoubtedly was “to re-establish the memory
of the Martyr of Canterbury.” To those with whom historic
truth comes foremost, and who have no special fanaticism,
sacerdotal or anti-sacerdotal, the effort of a “sacerdotal party”
to re-establish the memory of Thomas of Canterbury may
seem at least as worthy an object as to re-establish the
memory of Flogging Fitzgerald, or of King Harry himself.
To re-establish the memory of Thomas is, at the worst, a
question of words and names, and of a certain law: it does
not, like the other two re-establishments, imply the defence of
<!--401.png--><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a><span class="pageno">365</span>
any matter of wrong, or wicked lewdness. And the elder
Froude’s history of controversy, if undertaken with a purpose
of theological partisanship, was still a piece of creditable
historical work. Done forty years or so ago, it was, of course,
not up to the level of modern criticism on the subject. But
it was the beginning of modern criticism on the subject.
The elder Froude is entitled, at the hands of everyone who
writes or reads the story of Thomas, to that measure of
respectful thanks which belongs to a pioneer on any subject.
As for his spirit of partisanship, those who stand outside the
arena of all such partisanship might say that when the elder
Froude wrote, it was time that the other side should be heard,
in its turn. The name of Thomas à Becket had been so
long the object of vulgar and ignorant scorn; his character
and objects had been treated with such marked unfairness,
even by historians of real merit, that fair play might welcome
a vindication, even if it went too far the other way. Such a
vindication was the object of the elder Froude: in the course
of it, he got rid of several prevalent errors, and made ready
the way for more impartial and critical examination at the
hands of others. The elder Froude did something to put one
who, whatever were his objects, whatever were his errors, was
still a great and heroic Englishman, in a historic place more
worthy of him. At all events, he deserves better than to have
his work thus sneeringly spoken of by his own younger brother:
“And while Churchmen are raising up Becket as a brazen
serpent on which the world is to look to be healed of its
incredulities, the incredulous world may look with advantage
at him from its own point of view; and if unconvinced that he
was a Saint, may still find instruction in a study of his actions
and his fate.” This way of speaking may seem startling to
those who know the relation between the long-deceased
champion of the one side, and the living champion of the
other…. The point of view of those whose sole object
is historic truth may well be different either from the point of
view of “Churchmen,” or from that of the “incredulous world.”
At all events, historic truth has nothing to do with the point of
view of either.’</p>

From <cite>The Nineteenth Century</cite> for April, 1878, <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr>, 621. ‘A Few Words
on Mr. Freeman,’ by J. A. Froude.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Freeman commences with a sentence which is grossly
impertinent. “Natural kindliness,” he says, “if no other feeling,
might have kept back the fiercest of partisans from ignoring
the work of a long-forgotten brother.” How can Mr. Freeman
know my motive for not speaking of my brother in connection
with Becket, that he should venture upon ground so sensitive?
I mentioned no modern writers, except, once, Dean Stanley.
Natural kindliness would have been more violated if I had
specified my brother as a person with whose opinions on
the subject I was compelled to differ. I spoke of rehabilitation
of Becket as among the first efforts of the High Church
school. My brother’s <cite>Remains</cite> were brought out by the leaders
of that school after his death, as a party manifesto; and, for
my own part, I consider the publication of the <cite>Remains</cite> the
greatest injury that was ever done to my brother’s memory.
But this is venial, compared with what follows. He goes on:
“And from dealing stabs in the dark at a brother’s almost
forgotten fame.” “Stabs in the dark?” Can Mr. Freeman
have measured the meaning of the words which he is using?
If I had written anonymous articles attacking my brother’s
work, “stabs in the dark” would have been a correct expression;
and Mr. Freeman has correctly measured the estimate
likely to be formed of a person who could have been guilty of
doing anything so discreditable. Irrespective of “natural kindliness,”
I look back upon my brother as, on the whole, the most
remarkable man I have ever met in my life. I have never
seen any person,&mdash;not one! in whom, as I now think of him,
the excellences of intellect and character were combined in
fuller measure. Of my personal feeling towards him I cannot
speak. I am ashamed to have been compelled, by what I
can describe only as an inexcusable insult, to say what I have
said.’</p>

From <cite>The Contemporary Review</cite>, May, 1879, <abbr title="thirty-five">xxxv.</abbr>, 218 <i>et seq.</i>
‘Last Words on Mr. Froude,’ by E. A. Freeman.</p>

<p>‘… With regard to Mr. Froude’s treatment of his
brother’s writings, I see that what I have said has pained Mr.
Froude. I am so far sorry for it; but I do not admit that I
said anything beyond fair criticism. I know that the friends
of Mr. R. H. Froude were deeply pained by what
Mr. J. A. Froude wrote in his <cite>Life and Times of Thomas
Becket</cite>. I cannot say that I was pained, because I never
knew Mr. R. H. Froude. He was, to me, neither a friend nor
a kinsman, nor a man in whom I had any personal or party
interest. But as a student of twelfth-century history, I do owe
him a certain measure of thanks as a pioneer in one of my
subjects of study. Therefore, if not pained, like his personal
friends, I was indignant: because I thought that he was
unworthily treated, and that the treatment was the more
unworthy because it came from the hands of his own brother.
When I spoke of “stabs in the dark,” I meant that the victim
(I must use the word) was in the dark. Very few of Mr.
Froude’s readers would know that it was his own brother of
whom Mr. Froude was speaking, in a way which, brother or
no brother, I hold to be wholly undeserved.</p>

<p>‘But if any impartial judge thinks that I ought not to have
mentioned the fact of the kindred between the two writers, I
regret having done so.’</p>

Rivingtons, 1838. 2 <abbr title="volumes">vols.</abbr></p>

<p>‘[Richard Hurrell Froude] was the eldest son of the Venerable
Robert H[urrell] Froude, Archdeacon of Totnes, and was
born, and died, in the Parsonage House of Dartington, in the
county of Devon. He was born in 1803, on the Feast of the
Annunciation; and he died of consumption, on the 28th of
February, 1836, when he was nearly thirty-three, after an illness
of four years and a half. He was educated at Eton and Oxford,
<!--404.png--><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a><span class="pageno">368</span>
having previously had the great advantage, while at Ottery
Free School, of living in the family of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> George
Coleridge. He went to Eton in 1816, and came into
residence as a Commoner of Oriel College in the spring of
1821. In 1824 he took the degree of Bachelor of Arts, after
having obtained, on his examination, high, though not the
highest honours, both in the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Literæ Humaniores</cite> and the
<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Disciplinæ Mathematicæ et Physicæ</cite>. At Easter, 1826, he
was elected Fellow of his College, and, in 1827, was admitted
to his <abbr title="Master of Arts">M.A.</abbr> degree. The same year he accepted the office of
Tutor, which he held till 1830. In December, 1828, he
received Deacon’s Orders, and the year after, Priest’s, from
the last and present Bishops of Oxford.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_379" id="fnanchor_379"></a><a href="#footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></span> The disorder which
terminated his life first showed itself in the summer of 1831;
the winter of 1832, and the following spring, he passed in the
south of Europe; and the two next winters, and the year
between them (1834), in the West Indies. The illness which
immediately preceded his death lasted but a few weeks.</p>

<p>‘He left behind him a considerable collection of writings,
none prepared for publication: of which the following two
volumes form a part. The Journal, with which the first
commences, and which is continued in the Appendix, reaches
from the beginning of 1826, when he was nearly twenty-three,
to the spring of 1828. The Occasional Thoughts are carried
on to 1829. The Essay on Fiction was written when he was
twenty-three; the Sermons, from 1829 to 1833, when he was
between twenty-five and thirty.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_380" id="fnanchor_380"></a><a href="#footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></span> His Letters begin in 1823,
when he was twenty, and are carried down to within a month
of his death.</p>

<p>‘Those on whom the task has fallen of preparing these
various writings for publication, have found it matter of
great anxiety to acquit themselves so as to satisfy the claims
of duty, which they felt pressing on them in distinct, and,
sometimes, apparently opposite directions.</p>

<p>‘Some apology may seem requisite, in the first place, for
the very magnitude of the collection: as though authority were
<!--405.png--><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a><span class="pageno">369</span>
being claimed, in a preposterous way, for the opinions of one
undistinguished either by station or by known literary
eminence.</p>

<p>‘That apology, it is believed, will be found in the truth,
and extreme importance, of the views to the development of
which the whole is meant to be subservient; and also in the
instruction derivable from a full exhibition of the author’s
character as a witness to those views. This is the plea
which it is desired to bring prominently forward; nothing
short of this, it is felt, would justify such ample and unreserved
disclosures: neither originality of thought, nor engaging
imagery, nor captivating touches of character and turns
of expression.</p>

<p>‘Still more is this apology needed, on the more serious
grounds of friendship and duty. The publication of a
private Journal and private Letters is a serious thing. Too
often it has been ventured on, in a kind of reckless way,
with an eye singly to the good expected to be accomplished,
no regard being had to the author himself, and his wishes.
It is in itself painful, nay, revolting, to expose to the
common gaze papers only intended for a single correspondent;
and it seems little less than sacrilege to bring out
the solitary memoranda of one endeavouring to feel, and
to be, as much as possible alone with his God: secretly
training himself, as in His presence, in that discipline which
shuns the light of this world. To such a publication, it
were objection enough that it would seem to harmonise but
too well with the restless unsparing curiosity which now
prevails.</p>

<p>‘No common motive, then, it may be well believed, was
required to overcome the strong reluctance which even
strangers of ordinary delicacy, much more kinsmen and
intimate friends, must feel on the first suggestion of such
a proceeding. It may be frankly allowed that gentle and
good minds will naturally be prejudiced, in the outset,
against any collection of the sort. But the present is a
peculiar case, a case in which, if the survivors do not greatly
deceive themselves, they are best consulting the wishes of the
departed by publication, hazardous as that step commonly
<!--406.png--><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a><span class="pageno">370</span>
is. Let the reader, before he condemns, imagine to himself
a case like the following.</p>

<p>‘Let him suppose a person in the prime of manhood
(with what talents and acquirements is not now the question)
devoting himself, ardently yet soberly, to the promotion of
one great cause; writing, speaking, thinking on it for years,
as exclusively as the needs and infirmities of human life
would allow; but dying before he could bring to perfection
any of the plans which had suggested themselves to him
for its advancement. Let it be certainly known to his
friends that he was firmly resolved never to shrink from
anything, not morally wrong, which he had good grounds
to believe would really forward that cause: and that it
was real pain and disquiet to him if he saw his friends in
any way postponing it to his supposed feelings or interests.
Suppose, further, that having been for weeks and months in
the full consciousness of what was soon likely to befall him,
he departs, leaving such papers as make up the present
collection in the hands of those next to him in blood, without
any express direction as to the disposal of them; and that
they, taking counsel with the friends on whom he was known
chiefly to rely, unanimously and decidedly judged publication
most desirable for that end which was the guide of his life,
and which they too esteemed paramount to all others;
imagine the papers appearing to them so valuable, that they
feel as if they had no right to withhold such aid from the
cause to which he was pledged: would it, or would it not,
be their duty, as faithful trustees, in such case to overcome
their own scruples? would they, or would they not, be justified
in believing that they had, virtually, his own sanction for
publishing such parts even of his personal and devotional
memoranda, much more, of his letters to his friends, as
they deliberately judged likely to aid in the general good
effect?</p>

<p>‘This case of a person sacrificing himself altogether to
one great object, is not of everyday occurrence: it is not like
the too frequent instances of papers being ransacked and
brought to light, because the writer was a little more distinguished,
or accounted a little wiser, or better, than his
<!--407.png--><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a><span class="pageno">371</span>
neighbours: it cannot be fairly drawn into a precedent, except
in circumstances equally uncommon.</p>

<p>‘On the whole, supposing what in this Preface must be
supposed, the nobleness, and rectitude, and pressing nature of
the end which [Mr. Froude] had in view, the principle of
posthumous publication surely must, in this instance, be conceded?
The only question remaining will be whether the
selection has been judicious. On this, also, it may be well to
anticipate certain objections not unlikely to occur to sundry
classes of readers. If there be any who are startled at the
strong expressions of self-condemnation occurring so frequently,
both in the Journal and in the more serious parts of the
Correspondence, he will please to consider that the better
anyone knows, the more severely will he judge himself; and
since this writer sometimes thought it his duty to be very
plain-spoken in his censure of others, in fairness to him it
seemed right to show that he did not fail to look at home;
that he tried to be more rigid to himself than to anyone
else.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘Censure may be expected … [on] what will be called
the intolerance of certain passages: the keen sense which the
author expresses of the guilt men incur by setting themselves
against the Church. In fact, both this and the alleged
tendency to Romanism,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_381" id="fnanchor_381"></a><a href="#footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></span> are objections, not to the present
publication, but to the view which it is designed to support,
and do not therefore quite properly come within the scope of
this Preface. To defend the severe expressions alluded to
would be in a great measure to defend the old Catholic writers
for the tone in which they have spoken of unbelievers and
corrupters of the Faith. The same portions of Holy Scripture
<!--408.png--><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a><span class="pageno">372</span>
would be appealed to in both cases; those, namely, which
teach or exemplify the duty of austere reserve towards wilful
heretics, and earnest zeal against heresiarchs. Perhaps it may
be found that [Mr. Froude’s] demeanour and language on such
subjects is a tolerably striking and consistent illustration of
that sentiment of the Psalmist: “Do not I hate them, O Lord,
that hate Thee?” He hated them in their collective character,
as God’s enemies, as the antichristian party; but to all who
came in his way individually, he was, as many of his acquaintance
can testify, full of unaffected, open-hearted kindness;
entering into their feelings, and making allowance for their
difficulties, not the less scrupulously because he sometimes
found himself compelled to separate from them, or declare
himself against them.</p>

<p>‘To judge adequately of this point, we must, further, take
into account a certain strong jealousy which he entertained of
his own honesty of mind. He was naturally, or on principle,
a downright speaker, avoiding those words of course and of
compliment, which often, it may be feared, serve to keep up a
false peace at the expense of true Christian charity. His
words, therefore (playfulness and occasional irony apart), may
in general be taken more literally than those of most men. It
is easy to see that this would make his criticisms, whether
literary or moral, sound more pointed and unsparing than
those in which a writer of less frankness would indulge
himself. And this introduces another point, not unlikely to
be animadverted on as blameable, in the present selection.
Many, recoiling from his sentences, so direct, fearless, and
pungent, concerning all sorts of men and things, will be fain to
account them speeches uttered at random, more for present
point and effect, than to declare the speaker’s real opinion;
and, so judging, will of course disapprove of the collecting and
publishing such sayings, especially on high and solemn subjects,
as at best incautious, and perhaps irreverent. But they who
judge thus must be met by a denial of the fact. The expressions
in question were not uttered at random: he was not in
the habit of speaking at random on such matters. This is
remarkably evinced by the fact that to various friends, at
various times, conversing or writing on the same subjects, he
<!--409.png--><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"></a><span class="pageno">373</span>
was constantly employing the same illustrations and arguments,
very often the same words: as they found by comparison
afterwards, and still go on to find. Now maxims and reasonings
of which this may be truly affirmed, whatever else may be
alleged against them, cannot fairly be thrown by as mere
chance sayings. Right or wrong, they were deliberate
opinions, and cannot be left out of consideration, in a complete
estimate of a writer’s character and principles. The off-hand
unpremeditated way in which they seemed to dart out of him,
like sparks from a luminous body, proved only a mind entirely
possessed with the subject; glowing, as it were, through and
through.</p>

<p>‘Still, some will say, more selection might have been used,
and many statements at least omitted, which, however well
considered by himself, coming now, suddenly, as they do, on
the reader, appear unnecessarily startling and paradoxical.
But, really, there was little option of that kind, if justice were
to be done either to him or to the reader. His opinions had a
wonderful degree of consistency and mutual bearing; they
depended on each other as one whole: who was to take the
responsibility of separating them? Who durst attempt it,
considering especially his hatred of concealment and artifice?
Again: it was due to the reader to show him fairly how far
the opinions recommended would carry him. There is no wish
to disguise their tendencies, nor to withdraw them from such
examination as will prove them erroneous, if they are so.
Any homage which it is desired to render to his memory
would indeed be sadly tarnished, were he to be spoken or
written of in any spirit but that of an unshrinking openness
like his own. Such also is the tone of the Catholic Fathers,
and (if it may be urged without irreverence), of the Sacred
Writers themselves. Nothing, as far as we can find, is kept
back by them, merely because it would prove startling:
openness, not disguise, is their manner. This should not be
forgotten in a compilation professing simply to recommend
their principles. Nothing, therefore, is here kept back, but
what it was judged would be fairly and naturally misunderstood:
the insertion of which, therefore, would have been,
virtually, so much untruth.</p>

<p><!--410.png--><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a><span class="pageno">374</span>
‘Lastly, it may perhaps be thought of the Correspondence
in particular, that it is eked out with unimportant details,
according to the usual mistake of partial friends. The compilers,
however, can most truly affirm that they have had the
risk of such an error continually before their eyes, and have
not, to the best of their judgement, inserted anything, which did
not tell, indirectly perhaps but really, towards filling up that
outline of his mind and character, which seemed requisite to
complete the idea of him as a witness to Catholic views. It
can hardly be necessary for them to add, what the name of
Editor implies, that while they, of course, concur in his sentiments
as a whole, they are not to be understood as rendering
themselves responsible for every shade of opinion or
expression.</p>

<p>‘It remains only to commend these fragments, if it may be
done without presumption, to the same good Providence which
seemed to bless the example and instructions of the writer
while yet with us, to the benefit of many who knew him: that
“being dead,” he may “yet speak,” as he constantly desired to
do, a word in season for the Church of God: may still have
the privilege of awakening some of her members to truer and
more awful thoughts than they now have, of their own high
endowments and deep responsibility.’</p>

Part <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></p>

<p>‘It was of course impossible but that the quantity and
variety of censure, which was elicited by the publication of the
former part of these <cite>Remains</cite>, should be felt by the Editors as a
call for much calm and patient consideration, before proceeding,
in further fulfilment of their trust, to offer these additional
volumes to the world. One thing has at least become evident,
which was at first very uncertain: that it was a publication of
some importance for good or for evil. The notice which it has
attracted, favourable or otherwise, is at least a token that the
Editors were not mistaken, as partial friends are so apt to be,
<!--411.png--><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a><span class="pageno">375</span>
in their estimate of the force and originality of [Mr. Froude’s]
character, or of the keen, courageous, searching precision, with
which he had, though it were but incidentally, put forth his
ecclesiastical and theological opinions, and applied them to
things as they are.</p>

<p>‘But in such measure as all doubt on the importance of the
publication is removed, the responsibility of it is doubtless
enhanced; and it seems right to preface it with something like
a fair and full statement of the reasons why the Editors have
judged it, on the whole, their duty to persist in this step: not
wilfully slighting any man’s scruples or remonstrances, but still
thinking that the cause of the Church, which is paramount to
everything else, leaves them not at liberty either to withdraw
any important portion of what has been already made public,
or to suppress what remains. And what will be alleged for
perseverance now, will be found, perhaps in a good measure,
to justify the original publication; taken, as it must be, in aid
and in enforcement of the considerations offered in the Preface
to the first volume.</p>

<p>‘And first, if there be any persons, as undoubtedly there
are not a few, who think, more or less explicitly, that the
mere circumstance of a book’s raising an outcry constitutes
a strong objection to it, they are requested to put themselves
for a single moment so far in the position of the Editors,
as to imagine the case of [Mr. Froude’s] views being mainly
and substantially true; and then to consider how such outcry
could have been avoided. For if it be found that uneasiness,
discontent, clamour, nay, if you will, permanent unpopularity,
are the necessary results of a certain statement, supposing
it to be true, then the actual prevalence of such feelings,
however undesirable in itself, is no objection to the truth
of the statement, but rather an argument in its favour, as far
as it goes.</p>

<p>‘Suppose, for example, that the common opinions of the
Protestant world concerning the Sacrament of the Holy
Eucharist were indeed verging as near to a profane rationalism,
as these <cite>Remains</cite> in several passages assume: would not the
charge of superstition, mysticism, and Popery be echoed all
around, against both Author and Editors, much in the same
<!--412.png--><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a><span class="pageno">376</span>
way as it has been heard for the last few months? Suppose
it again true, that there is some secret but real and fatal connection
between the aforesaid faithless rationalism, and those
views regarding the great doctrines of Christianity and their
application to individual Christians, which have of late arrogated
to themselves exclusively the name of vital religion: is it not
certain that the disregard (for it is rather that than actual
opposition) which those views constantly meet with, at the hand
of this Author, would unite against him the champions of those
apparently opposite schemes, just in the manner in which we
see them actually united? If it should so be that there is a
large portion of Churchmen whom the circumstances of these
or of former times have led to form an exaggerated opinion of
the necessity and sacredness of the alliance of Church and
State; to sacrifice more or less of the very being of the Church,
in order, as they think, to secure its well-being: could it fail to
happen that such as these would be alarmed and disgusted at
the fearless uncompromising tone in which the inviolability of
the Church is here asserted, and the past and present tyranny
of the State, in every part of Christendom, denounced?
Lastly, should there be any considerable number of decent
religionists in the land, who would themselves make no scruple
of professing that hatred of “asceticism” is a main ingredient
in their notion of Christianity, it were little trouble to point
out the pages, in this work, at which they are likeliest to be
startled and disgusted: and yet it might be true, all the while,
that the writer’s views are Scriptural and Catholic, and those
which they have glided into, discountenanced by the Bible and
the Church.</p>

<p>‘So far, then, as the unfavourable criticism, with which these
<cite>Remains</cite> have been visited, may be set to the account of any
or all of the four classes now mentioned, it was of course to be
expected, nor is any particular deference due to it; and the
bitterer and louder it is, and the longer it lasts, the more reason
may it, perhaps, give, to a considerate person, for suspecting
that the words which provoked it were not altogether unseasonable.
But there seems to be a fear entertained, among persons
worthy of all respect, of no less an evil than encouragement
given to irreverence and lightness on sacred subjects, partly by
<!--413.png--><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a><span class="pageno">377</span>
certain opinions of [Mr. Froude], which would lead Englishmen
(it is feared) to disparagement of their Church as it is; partly
by something, in his tone and manner of writing, which many
find startling, and can hardly reconcile to themselves. To these
persons, and these feelings, a more particular explanation seems
due: and such will, therefore, be now attempted, though in no
sanguine expectation of satisfying them to any extent; yet
not altogether without hope that in some instances they may
be led to suspect their own misgivings, as arising from impulse
and habit, rather than from sound and true views of sacred
things.</p>

<p>‘The best way, perhaps, will be to commence by calmly
recalling a few plain facts. It is no long time ago, and yet the
career of events has been so rapid, that it seems far removed
from us: but let us endeavour to realise for a moment the
posture of mind in which sincere Churchmen found themselves,
in 1832 and 1833, when the Constitution of the country had
been changed by threats of violence, and the cry of Church
Reform was being raised with a view to a similar process, and
no person knew how much strength it might gather, or by what
unscrupulous means it might be enforced. The Liturgy, in
particular, seemed to be an object of attack; and the authority
of Bishops was so slighted, both in and out of Parliament, as to
make men apprehend that in no long time the whole functions
of the Church would be usurped by the State. At that crisis,
the writer of these <cite>Remains</cite> felt in common with not a few
others, but with a vividness and keenness of perception almost
peculiarly his own, that a call was given, and a time come, for
asserting in their simplicity the principles of the only Primitive
and True Church: those essential rights and duties which
seemed in danger of being surrendered, in mere ignorance, to
preserve certain external trappings. He surrendered himself to
this feeling, without reserve: he spoke, and wrote, and acted
from it continually; he devoted to it what remained of life
and health; and it seems to have been this, more than anything
else (excepting, perhaps, an unaffected mistrust concerning the
sincerity and depth of his own repentance), which caused the
sort of anxiety to recover, many times traceable in his correspondence.
To use the words which Walton has reported of
<!--414.png--><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a><span class="pageno">378</span>
Hooker, “he could have wished to live longer, to do the Church
more service.”</p>

<p>‘This being so, it cannot but be interesting and useful, now
that Providence has brought us a stage or two further on in the
warfare which he was among the foremost to commence, to
have the means of consulting such a record as the present
volumes supply, of the wishes, counsels, and anticipations of a
mind so rare as his, concerning the conduct and probable course
of the struggle. Those who have been sharers or approving
witnesses of the several gatherings (so to call them) which the
events of the last six years have occasioned, tending more or
less to the revival of old Church principles, will here find many
a sentiment which animated them half-unconsciously at the
time, not only expressed in a way to sink into men’s hearts,
but brought out in its full bearings and pursued to its legitimate
consequences: it was wild inarticulate music before, but
now we have the words and the meaning. And conversely,
events have been continually happening, which have tended in
a remarkable manner to illustrate [Mr. Froude’s] remarks and
confirm his prognostications: so that, already, many things
which sounded paradoxical and over-bold when he first uttered
them, may be ventured on with hope of a reasonable degree
of acceptance. His sagacity, it begins to be found, did but
anticipate the lessons of our experience. If he loved to dwell
on the noble act of Convocation in censuring Hoadly, and to
forebode the rising of the sun which set so brightly, the great
majority of the University of Oxford has since judged a like
warning, however painful on personal grounds, yet most
necessary, in regard of certain opinions not very unlike Hoadly’s.
If he speaks what some would call bitterly concerning any
party in the State, on account of an hostility to the Church,
whether conscious or instinctive, which he thought he discerned
in them, it seems now to be generally acknowledged that
the subsequent proceedings of that party have been such
as to justify a Churchman’s aversion. If he had what were
then esteemed exaggerated feelings about Parliamentary suppression
of Bishoprics, we have since seen the sense of the
Church so strongly expressed on that subject, as to force from
the Legislature the restoration of a See which had been actually
<!--415.png--><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a><span class="pageno">379</span>
extinguished, as far as any act of theirs could extinguish it.
If he deprecated the current notions about the necessity of
clerical endowments, good connections, and the like, as the most
effectual bar to all projects for true Church Extension; is not
the Church in our Colonies, even now, applying for Bishops
without endowment? and are not new Churches being everywhere
consecrated, at home, with only bare nominal endowment?
If he had learned of other times to regard each
Bishopric as a divinely instituted monarchy, and therefore to
condemn all intrusion on episcopal authority, by Parliaments or
otherwise, as not only disorderly, but profane, are not the
clergy of England even now, in the case of the Church Discipline
Bill, asserting that same principle against the authority
which, personally, they would most revere? If he had brought
himself habitually to contemplate the separation of Church and
State as not necessarily a fatal alternative, there have been
recent declarations, lay and ecclesiastical, to the same effect, in
quarters which cannot be suspected. The Church has been
congratulated on having “recovered herself” so far as “to feel
her own strength and look to her own resources”; on having
“become sensible that however desirous to act in unison with
the State, she can boast of an independent origin, and can, as
she has done before, exist in a state of independence.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_382" id="fnanchor_382"></a><a href="#footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></span> And
(to go no further in enumeration at present), if the writer of
these <cite>Remains</cite> thought very seriously of the importance of those
arrangements in Divine Service which tend most to remind the
worshipper that God’s house is a house of prayer and spiritual
sacrifice, not of mere instruction, we have but to look around us
on the new Churches, and new internal fittings-up of Churches,
which are in progress in most parts of the country, to be convinced
that on this point, also, men sympathise with him to a
much greater extent than they did.</p>

<p>‘Other instances might be mentioned, in which his judgement,
both of persons and things, has been remarkably verified,
even in so short a time; but these may be sufficient to explain
in some measure why his Editors should have been more than
usually scrupulous in suppressing any of his deliberate opinions
or forebodings, however lightly he might have chosen to express
<!--416.png--><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"></a><span class="pageno">380</span>
them. Long experience had taught them how much meaning
and truth lay hid even in his most casual observations on such
subjects; and how probable it was that those who were at first
startled by them, would, on mature consideration, find them
reasonable and right. And whereas it has been truly observed,
both in friendly and unfriendly quarters, that the
development of old principles, which now seems to be advancing,
is not such as to be accounted for by the efforts of any
particular individuals (it is something in the air, something
going on in all places at once, and in spite of all precautions);
it seemed a circumstance worth remarking, that it should have
been thus anticipated and rehearsed in a single mind: a mind
of itself inclined to rationalism, but checked first in that process,
and finally won from it, by resolute and implicit submission to
the lessons and rules of the Church in England, and rewarded
(if we may humbly judge) for such submission, by a more than
ordinary insight into the true claims of the Universal Church,
and the means of improving to the utmost our high privilege of
being yet in her Communion.</p>

<p>‘One who knew and appreciated him well (whatever subordinate
differences might exist between them), and whose
honoured name it is now more than ever a satisfaction to join
with his,&mdash;the late lamented Mr. Rose,&mdash;used to say of him,
that he was “not afraid of inferences”: meaning, as it would
seem, that he was gifted with a remarkable fearlessness in
regard of conclusions, when once his premisses were thoroughly
made good. To see his way rapidly and acutely, was common
to [Mr. Froude] with many: but to venture along it with uncompromising
faith, was, in a degree, peculiar to himself.
Perhaps it was this quality, humanly speaking, which kept
him always somewhat in advance of his time, and of those
with whom he most cordially acted. However, since it was in
him consistent, bearing fruit in action as well as in speculation,
and causing him to deny himself as unsparingly as he contradicted
popular opinions, it does seem to give all views of his
a peculiar claim to consideration, on the part of those who
agree with him in first principles. There will always be a fair
presumption, previous to inquiry, that his conclusions are the
legitimate result of propositions which we admit in common
<!--417.png--><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a><span class="pageno">381</span>
with him, but which we have not as yet the courage to follow
up as he did: not to dwell on the moral nobleness of such
fearless and devout adherence to the Truth. It is the very
description of Faith “to obey and go out, not knowing whither
it goes”; and a character of which that is the principal mark,
is surely not ill-fitted to exemplify what the whole Church may
soon be called on to practise. So far, in his papers and life
we seem to have, as it were, embodied a type of the kind of
resistance due to the spirit of this age on the part of the
Catholic Church, and of all her dutiful children. Could it be
right, merely through dread of censure incurred, or disturbance
given, to suppress such a document, providentially coming into
our hands?</p>

<p>‘Now when the great principle of Catholicism, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod semper,
quod ubique, quod ab omnibus</i>, had once rooted itself in the mind
of a person thus determined not to flinch from results; when
he had once come to be convinced that the only safe way for
the Church is to go back to the times of universal consent, so
far as that is possible, inasmuch as such universal consent is no
doubtful indication of His Will, in Whom we are all one Body,&mdash;would
he not naturally go on and say to himself: “If I lay
down this rule on one question, I shall not be dealing fairly
with myself, honestly with my opponents, reverently with Him
to Whom I am virtually appealing, except I carry the same
mode of reasoning into all other questions also, wherein it is
applicable? Accepting the Church’s interpretation of Scripture
as to the necessity of real outward Baptism, I must accept it,
also, as to the connection of the Gift of Regeneration exclusively
with Baptism; accepting her view of the Sacrament of
the Holy Eucharist, I must not decline her doctrine of the
accompanying Sacrifice, gathered from the same Liturgies and
the same interpretation of Holy Scripture; believing her concerning
the genuineness of the Bible, I must believe her also
concerning a transmitted Priesthood; taking it on trust from
her Creeds that such and such is the only true account of the
doctrines of the Bible, I may not doubt her consistent and
perpetual witness that such and such are the right rules for
interpreting the same holy Book; I believe, because she assures
me, that Bishops only have the right to ordain; must I not
<!--418.png--><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a><span class="pageno">382</span>
believe her equally positive assurance that Excommunication
is also theirs by exclusive and indefeasible right, and that it is
no true Eucharist which is not consecrated by hands which
they have authorised?” These are instances of the manner
in which the Author of these papers reasoned; and certainly,
at first sight, there seems to be much force in his mode of
reasoning; the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">onus probandi</i> seems cast on those who demur
to it. It seems, if it were not for its practical consequences,
more satisfactory than the summary ways of dealing with such
matters, which we find not seldom adopted; fairer and more
ingenuous than the saying: “Times are altered; it might be
all right then, but it does not follow that it is so now”; more
reverential than the other saying: “The Fathers were good
sort of men, but no number of fallible beings can make an
infallible Church”; more in harmony with Scripture and with
God’s general Providence, than to dismiss such portions of the
ancient system as we think proper, with the aphorism: “It
may be, and has been abused, and therefore is best let alone.”
And having all these advantages, it seemed to him part of
Faith to suppose that, in the end, it would prove also the best
and most effective way of maintaining the Truth of God against
superstition and idolatry, as well as against scepticism and profane
exaltation of reason.</p>

<p>‘But further: such a mind as is here supposed, thoroughly
uncompromising in its Catholicity, would feel deeply that as
ancient consent binds the person admitting it alike to all
doctrines, interpretations, and usages, for which it can be truly
alleged; so there is something less tangible and definite, though
not less real than any of these, which no less demands his
dutiful veneration, and to which he is bound to conform himself
in practice: that is to say, the cast of thought and tone of
character of the Primitive Church, its way of judging, behaving,
expressing itself, on practical matters, great and small, as they
occur. For what, in fact, is this character, but what an
Apostle once called it: “the mind of Jesus Christ” Himself,
by the secret inspiration of His Spirit communicated to His
whole mystical Body, informing, guiding, moving it, as He will?
A sacred and awful truth: of which whoever is seriously aware
will surely be very backward to question or discuss the propriety
<!--419.png--><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"></a><span class="pageno">383</span>
of any sentiment allowed to be general in Christian antiquity,
how remote soever from present views and usages; much more,
to treat it with anything like contempt or bitterness.</p>

<p>‘Should it appear to him, for example, that the Ancient
Church took in their literal and obvious meaning those expressions
of Our Saviour and of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul, which recommend
celibacy as the more excellent way, so as to give honour to
those who voluntarily so abode, that they might wait on the
Lord; and in particular, to assume that the clergy should
rather, of the two, be unmarried than married:&mdash;he will not
permit the prejudices of a later time to hinder him from
honouring those whom his Lord so delighted to honour; he
will consider that the same cast of thought which leads men to
scorn religious celibacy, will certainly prevent marriage also,
which they profess to honour, from being strictly religious.
Should he find that the records of the Fathers bear witness in
every page to their literal observance of the duty of fasting,
and the high importance which they attached to it, it is not the
titles of Jewish, Pharisaical, self-righteous, nor yet that of ascetic
(more widely dreaded than all!) which will deter him from
obeying his conscience in that particular. Should he perceive
that the counsels and demeanour of the holy men of old towards
heretics and other sinners, correspond much more truly with
the Apostolic rule, “Put away from among yourselves that
wicked person,” than with the liberal and unscrupulous intercourse
which respectable persons now practise, for peace, and
quietness, and good-nature’s sake; it is a conviction which
cannot but widely influence both his judgment of other times,
and his conduct towards his contemporaries. It will lead to
many a sentence that will sound harsh, and many a step that
will be counted austere; it will cause him often to shock those by
whom he would greatly wish to be approved; and yet, thus he
must judge and act, if he will be true to his own principle, and
conform himself throughout to that Will of God which the
consent of those purer ages indicates.</p>

<p>‘Another very distinguishable circumstance in the tone and
manner of the early Church is its reverential reserve with
regard to holy things: of all its characteristics apparently the
most unaccountable to the spirit of the present age. This also
<!--420.png--><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384"></a><span class="pageno">384</span>
we may expect to discover in a true, courageous, consistent
follower of the ancients: not so much by any conscious
endeavour of his, as because it will come to him instinctively,
as some birds are said to contrive ways for enticing observers
away from their nests. And because it is reserve, we may
expect now and then to be startled at the very form of it. The
nature of the thing excludes conventional expressions, and
drives people, often, on such as are rather paradoxical; deep
reverence will occasionally veil itself, as it were, for a moment,
even under the mask of its opposite, as earnest affection is
sometimes known to do. Any expedient, almost, will be
adopted by a person who enters with all his heart into this
portion of the ancient character, rather than he will contradict
that character altogether by a bare, unscrupulous, flaunting
display of sacred things or good thoughts.</p>

<p>‘Once more: he who makes up his mind really to take
Antiquity for his guide, will feel that he must be continually
realising the presence of a wonder-working God; his mind
must be awake to the possibility of special providences,
miraculous interferences, supernatural warnings, and tokens of
the divine Purpose, and also to indications of other unseen
agency, both good and bad, relating to himself and others:
subjects of this sort, if a man be consistent, must fill up a
larger portion of his thoughts and affections, and influence his
conduct far more materially, than the customs and opinions of
this age would readily permit.</p>

<p>‘Other particulars might be mentioned; but these which
have been enumerated are surely sufficient to teach persons a
little caution how they apply the readily occurring words, “overstrained,
fanatical, ascetic, bigoted,” to notions and practices
such as have been now alluded to. Previous to examination,
they cannot be sure that any such notion or practice is not a
development of the character which Our Lord from the
beginning willed should be impressed on His Church. If we
have not the boldness to take it on ourselves, and follow the
Lamb whithersoever He goeth, at least let us not throw
stumbling-blocks in the way of those who are more courageously
disposed! When a thing is fairly proved superstitious,
uncharitable, ascetic in a bad sense, unwarranted by Scripture
<!--421.png--><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385"></a><span class="pageno">385</span>
and Antiquity, then let it be blamed and rejected, not before;
lest we incur such a rebuke as he did, who, with more zeal
than knowledge, would have prevented Our Lord Himself, as
these would the least of His brethren and members, from
taking up and bearing the Cross. It was in love to Christ
that he remonstrated; yet what was Christ’s reproof? “Get
thee behind Me, Satan; thou art an offence unto Me; for
thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things
that be of men….”</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘We should not, perhaps, be duly thankful for so much of
the Apostolical Ritual, preserved to us by a gracious Providence,
if we were not sometimes called on to take notice how
narrowly we have escaped losing the whole: neither, again,
can our escape be rightly appreciated, without taking into the
account the tendency of the school to which our Reformers
had joined themselves, and the little dependence that could
be placed on their love of Antiquity, as a safeguard against
that evil tendency. All this, of course, implies that whatever
praise and admiration may be due to individuals, both some of
the principles of the movement which is called the Reformation,
in the several countries of Europe, and in parts also, the tone
of character which it encouraged, were materially opposed to
those of the Early Church. At the risk of prolonging these
remarks, already much longer than is desirable in a Preface,
a few heads shall be mentioned, to which [Mr. Froude] would
probably have referred, as mainly accounting for his feelings on
this matter.</p>

<p>‘First of all, he would have complained of their tone with
regard to the Apostolical Succession; not this or that writer
only, but the general body who favoured that cause, treating it
as no better than a politic invention to secure the influence of
Church governors, in the absence of true doctrine and visible
spiritual gifts. Nor would he probably have thought this
charge answered by any number of quotations from their
writings, apparently tending the contrary way: because, where
opposite sets of quotations may be adduced from the same
writer, and from compositions of the same date, either his
opinions are so far neutralised, or we must ascertain by his
<!--422.png--><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a><span class="pageno">386</span>
conduct, his connections, the cast of his sentiments generally,
and such other evidence as we can get, in which of the two
statements he was overruled, and in which left to the free
expression of his own mind. By the same mode of inquiry,
he would come to judge unfavourably of their tenets about
Sacramental Grace, especially in the Holy Eucharist; about
the Power of the Keys, and the sacredness of the ancient
Discipline; and about State interference in matters spiritual;
although in this latter point, especially, their conduct spoke
out for them too plainly to admit of any construction but one.
Anyone who pleases, may verify or contradict the impressions
of [Mr. Froude] on these and similar points, by simply examining
the remains of the principal Reformers, with such
cautions as are above indicated. Until he has done so, and
satisfied himself that those impressions were not merely
erroneous, but such as no student of tolerable fairness could
adopt, it may be questioned whether he has much right broadly
and positively to condemn [Mr. Froude], for wishing “to have
nothing to do with such a set.”</p>

<p>‘And this more especially, if he take into consideration,
likewise, certain less palpable but not less substantial differences
in the way of thinking and moral sentiment, which
separate the Reformers from the Fathers, more widely, perhaps,
than any definite statements of doctrine. Compare the sayings
and manner of the two schools on the subjects of fasting,
celibacy, religious vows, voluntary retirement and contemplation,
the memory of the Saints, rites and ceremonies recommended
by Antiquity, and involving any sort of self-denial,
and especially on the great point of giving men divine knowledge,
and introducing holy associations, not indiscriminately,
but as men are able to bear it: there can be little doubt that,
generally speaking, the tone of the fourth century is so unlike
that of the sixteenth, on each and all of these topics, that it
is absolutely impossible for the same mind to sympathise with
both. You must choose between the two lines: they are not
only diverging, but contrary.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘But some say: “Whether right or wrong in his views,
[Mr. Froude] ought not to have spoken so rudely of these
<!--423.png--><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a><span class="pageno">387</span>
subjects”: and this brings us to the second head of offence, his
way of expressing his sentiments on grave matters, generally.
Such censurers appear to forget that his feelings are conveyed
to us in familiar Letters, and of course, as his other <cite>Remains</cite>
prove, in a different tone and manner from that which he
would have adopted had he been preparing to give the
expression of them to the world: not, however, more unsuited
to the occasion than the epistolary tone and manner of very
many imaginative persons, on points concerning which, nevertheless,
they feel the deepest and most serious interest. This
however, it may be thought, is only shifting the blame from
him on his Editors. But it will be found that his phrases,
however sportive, or even flippant, in their sound, had each
their own distinct meaning, embodied his views, and the
reasons of them, often in a wonderfully brief space, and could
not be omitted without much loss of instruction, and frequent
risk of missing their point and meaning. Like proverbial
modes of speech, they were, of course, not always to be taken
literally, though the principle they contained might be true in
its fullest extent. Thus he once told a friend that he was
“with the Romanists in religion, and against them in politics.”
Again he says, in a letter to a friend: “When I come home, I
mean to read and write all sorts of things; for now that one is
a Radical, there is no use in being nice!” In another: “We
will have a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vocabularium apostolicum</i>, and I will start it with
four words: ‘pampered aristocrats,’ ‘resident gentlemen,’
‘smug parsons,’ ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pauperes Christi</i>.’ I shall use the first on
all occasions; it seems to me just to hit the thing. How is it
we are so much in advance of our generation?”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_383" id="fnanchor_383"></a><a href="#footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Next, the reader is requested to consider whether a good
deal of what has startled him in that way may not be accounted
for by the nature of <ins title="eirôneia">εἰρωνεία</ins>: not mere ludicrous irony, according
to the popular English sense of that word, but a kind of
Socratic reserve, an instinctive dissembling of his own high
feelings and notions, partly through fear of deceiving himself
and others, partly (though it may sound paradoxical) out of
very reverence, giving up at once all notion of doing justice
to sacred subjects, and shrinking from nothing so much as the
<!--424.png--><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a><span class="pageno">388</span>
disparagement of them by any kind of affectation. This
whole topic admits of forcible illustration from different
persons’ ways of reading sacred compositions. There is an
apparently unconcerned mode of enunciation, which in fact
arises from people’s realising, or at least trying to realise, their
own utter incompetency to speak such words aright. Again,
of all the serious persons in the world, it is probable that no
two could be found who would thoroughly enter into each
other’s tones and expression. We must have a little faith
in our neighbour’s earnestness, in order not to think his reading
affected. A little consideration will perhaps show that most
of what some might be tempted to call harsh, or coarse, or
irreverent in this work, may be accounted for in the manner
here indicated: <i>e.g.</i>, [Mr. Froude’s] playful custom of speaking
of his own and his friends’ proceedings in the language which
an enemy would adopt: calling himself and his friends
“ecclesiastical agitators,” their plans for doing good “a conspiracy,”
and the effect of them “poisoning people’s minds”:
and his use of cant schoolboy words, which no doubt has
disgusted many, may be referred to the same head.</p>

<p>‘Often, indeed, he seemed instinctively to put his own or
his friends’ views and characters in the most objectionable
light in which they could be represented, as if to show that
he was fully aware of the popular view which would be taken
of what he approved, or the arguments against it which would
seem plausible to the many; and that he was not in the least
moved by it. Thus he somewhere utters a wish that “the
‘march of mind’ in France might yet prove a bloody one.”
Elsewhere he regrets “that anything should be done to avert
what seems our only chance:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_384" id="fnanchor_384"></a><a href="#footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></span> a spoliation on a large scale!”
Thus he habitually forced his mind to face the worst consequences
or the most unfavourable aspect of his own wish
or opinion, the most obnoxious associations with which it could
be connected: and therefore used terms expressive of those
consequences or associations. It was one form of his horror
of self-deceit. Put these things together: add also the fertility
of his mind, his humour, his pointed mode of expression,
his consciousness of fearless integrity, his hatred of half-truths
<!--425.png--><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a><span class="pageno">389</span>
and cowardly veils, his confidence in his friends’ understanding
him and allowing for him: and it will be found that they
go far towards explaining the manner, just as the principle
of adhering to Antiquity accounts for the matter, of what he
says. But if after due allowance made for all these things,
there should still remain more than we can easily reconcile
ourselves to, in the way either of severity, or of seeming
rudeness of speech; coldness where we expected fervour, and
criticism where we looked for sympathy; we shall do well to
remember, that the fault, if there be a fault, is not necessarily
all on [Mr. Froude’s] side: it may be right to suspend our
judgment, till we have ascertained whether these things be
not in fact due to the character of Christian Antiquity, which
he might be unconsciously realising in greater perfection than
his age could yet bear.</p>

<p>‘Does there yet remain something that troubles us, something
that we cannot at all explain? We must not forget
(it is a deep and high allusion, but not, it is humbly trusted,
altogether irrelevant to this case), that, as all other manifestations
of Our Lord, so those which He has vouchsafed to
make of Himself in His Saints, have ever been more or less
mysterious and unaccountable. Which of the great Scripture
characters is there, whose conduct, even that part of it which
the Holy Spirit seems to mention approvingly, is not, in some
respect or another, a riddle and a paradox to us, with our
modern views? Are there not things recorded of the Ancient
Church which we know not how to enter into, yet must needs
venerate because she gave them her sanction? Nay, and is
it not very conceivable that every one of those approved in
God’s sight would be in like manner, were his history fully
disclosed, “a monster” (as the Psalmist phrases it) to every
other? that Faith is necessary, in a degree, for our holding
by Christ in any one of His members, as it is the great
requisite whereby we keep hold of Him our Head? These
remarks are, of course, hypothetical: nothing is asserted of
peculiar sanctity in any one: only it seemed advisable to
remind men, that where there are appearances in one part of
a character of holiness and self-denial in a remarkable degree,
there we may expect, by a kind of law of God’s Providence,
<!--426.png--><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a><span class="pageno">390</span>
to find, in other matters, something very much beside our
expectations, and unlike our own moral taste.</p>

<p>‘At the same time, it should not be forgotten that there
are persons in the world to whom this very disposition to
irony and playfulness, and what we may perhaps call a
certain youthfulness of expression, serves to recommend [Mr.
Froude’s] views, and attract them to him. That seeming
lightness, which was natural to him, is natural also to some
others, perhaps not a few: and it is useful that they should
have the means of knowing that it is not inconsistent with
high and earnest thoughts of things invisible, and strict rules
of Christian obedience.</p>

From ‘<span class="smcap">Reminiscences chiefly of Oriel College and

<abbr title="Master of Arts">M.A.</abbr> 2 <abbr title="volumes">vols.</abbr> Longmans, Green &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, 1882.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_385" id="fnanchor_385"></a><a href="#footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></span></p>

<p class="center small">[By the kind permission of Mrs. T. Mozley, and of Messrs. Longmans &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>]</p>

<p>‘If there ever could be any question as to the master spirit
of this Movement, which now would be a very speculative
question indeed, it lies between John Henry Newman and
Richard Hurrell Froude. Froude was a man, such as there
are now and then, of whom it is impossible for those that have
known him to speak without exceeding the bounds of common
admiration and affection. He was elder brother of William,
the distinguished engineer, who died lately, after rendering,
and while still rendering, most important services to the
Admiralty, and of Anthony, the well-known historian, the sons
of Archdeacon Froude, a scholar and no mean artist. Richard
came to Oriel from Eton, a school which does not make every
boy a scholar, if it even tries to do so, but which somehow
implants in every nature a generous ambition of one kind or
other.</p>

<p>‘As an undergraduate, he waged a ruthless war against
sophistry and loud talk, and he gibbeted one or two victims,
labelling their sophisms with their names. Elected to a Fellowship,
and now the companion of Newman and Pusey, not to
speak of elders and juniors, he had to wield his weapons more
reverentially and warily. But he had no wish to do otherwise….
Froude’s voice combined the gravity and authority of age with
all the charms of youth, for he might be at once reasoning with
a senate, and amusing a circle of children…. He was a bold
rider. He would take a good leap when he had the chance,
and would urge his friends to follow him, mostly in vain….
Froude delighted in taking his friends for a gallop in Blenheim
Park, to the no small peril of indifferent riders, for the horses
became wild, and went straight under the low hanging branches
of the wide-spreading oaks.</p>

<p>‘His figure and manner were such as to command the confidence
<!--428.png--><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392"></a><span class="pageno">392</span>
and affection of those about him. Tall, erect, very
thin, never resting or sparing himself, investigating and explaining
with unwearied energy, incisive in his language, and
with a certain fiery force of look and tone, he seemed a sort of
angelic presence to weaker natures. He slashed at the shams,
phrases, and disguises in which the lazy or the pretentious veil
their real ignorance or folly. His features readily expressed
every varying mood of playfulness, sadness, and awe. There
were those about him who would rather writhe under his most
cutting sarcasms than miss their part in the workings of his
sympathy and genius.</p>

<p>‘Froude was a Tory, with that transcendental idea of the
English gentleman which forms the basis of Toryism. He was
a High Churchman of the uncompromising school, very early
taking part with Anselm, Becket, Laud, and the Nonjurors.
Woe to anyone who dropped in his hearing such phrases as
the Dark Ages, superstition, bigotry, right of private judgement,
enlightenment, march of mind, or progress. When a stray man
of science fell back on “law,” or a “subtle medium,” or any
other device for making matter its own lord and master, it was
as if a fox had broken cover: there ensued a chase and no
mercy. Luxury, show, and even comfort he despised and denounced.
He very consistently urged that the expenses of
Eton should be kept down so low as to enable every ordinary
incumbent to send his sons there to be trained for the ministry.
All his ideas of College life were frugal and ascetic. Having
need of a press for his increasing papers and books, he had
one made of plain deal. It must have been Woodgate who
came in one day, and finding some red chalk, ornamented the
press with grotesque figures, which long were there. Froude
and Newman induced several of the Fellows to discontinue
wine in the Common Room. As they had already had a
glass or two at the high table, they did not require more.
There was only one objection to the discontinuance, but it was
fatal at last; and that was its inconvenience when strangers
were present. This preference of tea to wine was no great
innovation in Oriel. When I came up at Easter, 1825, one
of the first standing jokes against the College, all over the
University, was the “Oriel teapot,” supposed to be always ready,
<!--429.png--><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393"></a><span class="pageno">393</span>
the centre of the Oriel circle, and its special inspiration. How
there ever came to be such an idea I cannot guess, but wherever
I went, when I passed the wine, I was asked whether I would
not prefer some tea, much to the amusement of the table.</p>

<p>‘Self-renunciation in every form [Froude] could believe in;
most of all in a gentleman, particularly one of a good Devonshire
family. His acquaintance with country gentlemen had
been special, perhaps fortunate. He had not been in the north<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_386" id="fnanchor_386"></a><a href="#footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></span>
of England, in the eastern counties, or in the midlands. It was
therefore in perfect simplicity that, upon hearing one day the
description of a new member in the Reformed Parliament, he
exclaimed: “Fancy a gentleman not knowing Greek!” I chanced
one day to drop, most inconsiderately, that all were born alike,
and that they were made what they are by circumstances and
education. Never did I hear the end of that. No retraction
or qualification would avail….</p>

<p>‘… In July, 1832, the <cite>History of the Arians</cite> was ready
for the press, and as Newman was now relieved of his College
duties, he was more a man of leisure than he had ever been,
and was also in more need of rest. Hurrell Froude (as Richard
was always called, though there was another Hurrell in the
family) had now to submit to be ruled by his anxious relatives.
He must spend the winter on the Mediterranean and its shores,
… and Newman was easily persuaded to go with him. In these
days, it requires little persuasion to induce ordinary people who
happen to be free from pressing engagements, to accept the
offer of a Continental trip, especially southward, in the winter.
But this did rather take Newman’s friends by surprise: the
only reason they could suppose was his great anxiety for
Hurrell Froude…. He never made a tour for pleasure’s sake,
for health’s sake, or for change’s sake. He did move about a
good deal, but it was to the country parsonages to which so
many of his friends were early relegated….</p>

<p>‘… It must have been soon after Froude’s return from the
Mediterranean that I had with him one of our old talks about
architecture. He was as devoted to science and as loyal to it
as any materialist could be. But architecture and science are
very apt to be at variance, and Froude was always disposed to
<!--430.png--><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a><span class="pageno">394</span>
side with the latter. As for Greek architecture, there is no
science in it except the mystery of proportion and a certain
preternatural and overpowering conception of beauty. The
Temple of Egesta, which won the hearts of our travellers, has
no more science in its construction than Stonehenge. But
Roman architecture was for all the world, for its gods as well
as for its mortals. The arch, and still more the vault, were
mighty bounds into the time to come.</p>

<p>‘Always leaning on tradition where possible, Froude wished
to believe the pointed arch the natural suggestion of a row of
round arches seen in perspective. Of course, a deep round arch
in a thick wall only shows its roundness when you stand
directly before it, but seems pointed from any other direction.
I remember ventilating this idea to Sir Richard Westmacott
and Turner, the great painter, at the former’s table, and I remember
also the great contempt with which the latter dismissed
such mechanical ideas from the realm of the picturesque. But
it was the dome that chiefly exercised Froude’s mind. It was
a positive pain to him that so grand a building as the Parthenon
should have been constructed, as he believed, in such ignorance
of science. His notion was that if Agrippa had known the
qualities of the catenary curve he would have used it, instead
of the semi-circular curve: that is, in this instance, the spherical
vault…. Had any common utilitarian made such a suggestion
I should not have thought it worth notice. I only mention it
as showing the scientific character of Froude’s tastes. The
objections are obvious and overwhelming. In the first place,
beauty must lead in architecture, and construction must obey….
Spherical domes are the crux and the pitfall of architecture.
They involve false construction and positive deception….
Froude had a soul for beauty; but he did not like shams.
He did not like a thing to seem what it was not. Few buildings
are prepared to stand such a test. Amiens Cathedral, for
example, the first love of the English tourist, is nothing more
than an iron cage filled in with stone…. Robert Wilberforce
had been much impressed with Cologne Cathedral and with
the galleries of early art at Munich. It is an illustration of the
turning of the tide, and of the many smaller causes contributing
to the Movement, that in 1829, German agents (one of them
<!--431.png--><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395"></a><span class="pageno">395</span>
with a special introduction to Robert Wilberforce) filled Oxford
with very beautiful and interesting tinted lithographs of mediæval
paintings, which have probably, long ere this, found their way to
a thousand parsonages: a good many to Brompton Oratory!…
About the same time, there came an agent from Cologne
with very large and beautiful reproductions of the original design
for the Cathedral, which it was proposed to set to work
on, with a faint hope of completing it before the end of the
century. Froude gave thirty guineas for a set of the drawings,
went wild over them, and infected not a few of his friends with
mediæval architecture. As an instance of the way in which
religious sentiment was now beginning to be disassociated from
practical bearings and necessities, Froude would frequently
mention the exquisitely finished details at York Minster and
other Churches, in situations where no eye but the eye of
Heaven could possibly reach them…. He was most deeply
interested in architecture, but it is plain that he was more
penetrated and inspired by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_387" id="fnanchor_387"></a><a href="#footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></span> than even by Cologne
Cathedral. After spending three days with me in taking
measurements, tracings, mouldings, and sketches of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles
at Oxford, one of the purest specimens of Early English, he
devoted a good deal of time at Barbados to designing some
homely Tuscan addition to Codrington College….</p>

<p>‘It was now [1833] deep in Long Vacation, but no period
in the annals of Oxford was ever more pregnant with consequences
than the next two months. The returning travellers
had lost time. The world had got the start of them, and
they had to make up for it. Froude’s imagination teemed
with new ideas, new projects, topics likely to tell or worth
trying; to be tried, indeed, and found variously successful.
They came from him like a shower of meteors, bursting
out of a single spot in a clear sky, for they had been
pent up. Every post had brought the travellers some account
of fresh “atrocities.” <cite>The Examiner</cite> was the only paper
<!--432.png--><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a><span class="pageno">396</span>
that talked sense. Conservative Churchism Froude now
utterly abhorred. In passing through France, he had listened
with hopefulness to the dream that a deeper descent into
republicanism than that represented by Louis Philippe, would
land that country in High Churchism. How could the Church
of England now be saved? By working out the oath of
canonical obedience? By a lay synod, pending the apostasy
of Parliament? By a race of clergy living less like country
gentlemen? By dealing in some way or other with the
appointment of Bishops? By a systematic revival of religion
in large towns; in particular, by colleges of unmarried priests?
By Excommunication? By working upon the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pauperes Christi</i>?
By writing up the early Puritans, who had so much to say for
themselves against the tyranny of Elizabeth? By preaching
Apostolic Succession? By the high sacramental doctrine?
By attacking State interference in matters spiritual? By an
apostolic vocabulary giving everything its right name? By
recalling the memory of the Gregorian age?</p>

<p>‘It was perhaps a happy diversion of his thoughts that he
had so much to say on other topics, such as architecture, and
the construction of ships and dock-gates. It was now plain
that he had brought home with him not only his own fervid
temperament, but some of the heat of sunny climes, where
indeed he had not taken proper care of his health, or any care
at all. Like most other Englishmen, he would not be indoors
by sunset, or put on warmer clothing when the thermometer
dropped 20 or 30°. It happened to be an exceptionally cold
winter in the Mediterranean. As far as regards health, the
experiment had been a failure.</p>

<p>‘One thing, however, is quite clear from his Letters and
other remains; and, as he was all this time somewhat in advance
of Newman, it has a bearing on his mental history. Froude
came home even more utterly set against Roman Catholics
than he had been before. His conclusion was that they held
the Truth in unrighteousness; that they were “wretched
Tridentines everywhere,” and of course, ever since the Reformation;
that the conduct and behaviour of the clergy was
such that it was impossible they could believe what they
professed, that they were idolaters in the sense of substituting
<!--433.png--><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397"></a><span class="pageno">397</span>
easy and good-natured divinities for the God of Truth and
Holiness.</p>

<p>‘Froude stayed in England just long enough to take a
present part in the great Movement, and to contribute to it,
and then, as he sorrowfully said of himself, “like the man who
‘fled full soon, on the first of June, but bade the rest keep
fighting,’” he found himself compelled by his friends to leave
England for the West Indies.</p>

<p>‘All these vivid expressions, delivered with the sincerity of
a noble child or a newly-converted savage, chimed in with
Newman’s state of feeling, and struck deep into his very being,
to bring forth fruit. Yet in neither Froude nor Newman
could now be discovered the least suspicion of what these
outbursts might lead to, for at every point they found Rome
irreconcilable and impossible.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘Froude, who had now bidden farewell to Toryism, much
in the same key as he had written of old Tyre and the Cities
of the Plain, was contributing to the <cite>Tracts</cite>, from Barbados,
and also freely criticising them when they seemed to him
to temporise, or to fall into modern conventionalisms. In
fact he was keeping Newman, nothing loth, up to the
mark.</p>

<p>‘In May, 1835, he returned from Barbados. On landing,
he found a letter from Newman calling him to Oxford, where
there were several friends soon to part for the Long Vacation.
His brother Anthony was summoned from his private tutor,
Mr. Hubert Cornish. Froude came, full of energy and fire,
sunburnt, but a shadow. The tale of his health was soon
told. He had a “button in his throat” which he could not
get rid of, but he talked incessantly. With a positive hunger
for intellectual difficulties, he had been studying Babbage’s
calculating machine, and he explained, at a pace which seemed
to accelerate itself, its construction, its performances, its failures,
and its certain limits. Few, if any, could follow him, still less
could they find an opening for aught they had to say, or to
beg a minute’s law. He never could realise the laggard pace
of duller intelligences. I have not the least doubt he did
his best to explain Babbage’s machine to his black Euclid
<!--434.png--><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398"></a><span class="pageno">398</span>
class at Codrington College, and that without ever ascertaining
the result in their minds….</p>

<p>‘… Froude was brimful of irony, and always ready to
surprise and even shock men of a slower temperament, when
he could by a smile smooth or disarm them. As he talked,
so he wrote in his letters. The Editors of his <cite>Remains</cite> were
under a temptation, which they construed into a necessity,
to reproduce him as he really had been, to the very words and
the life, and let his words take their chance. Upon the
whole, they were right; for no one ever charged, or could
now charge, on Froude, that his expressions had brought
anyone to Rome, or could doubt that Froude himself was
Anglican to the last….</p>

<p>‘… There had never been seen at Oxford, indeed seldom
anywhere, so large and noble a sacrifice of the most precious
gifts and powers to a sacred cause. The men who were
devoting themselves to it were not bred for the work, or from
one school. They were not literary toilers or adventurers
glad of a chance, or veterans ready to take to one task as
lightly as to another, equally zealous to do their duty, and
equally indifferent to the form. They were not men of the
common rank, casting a die for promotion. They were not
levies or conscripts, but in every sense volunteers. Pusey,
Keble, and Newman had each an individuality capable of a
development, and a part beyond that of any former scholar,
poet, or theologian in the Church of England. Each lost
quite as much as he gained by the joint action of the three.
It is hard to say what Froude might have been, or might
not have been, had he lived but a few more years, and been
content to cast in his lot with common mortals bound by
conditions of place and time.’</p>

<div class="chapter"><a name="Vol2_398" id="Vol2_398"></a>
<p class="p2 hanging">From ‘<span class="smcap">The British Critic and Quarterly Theological
Review</span>,’ April, 1840. [By the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <span class="smcap">T. Mozley</span>.]<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_388" id="fnanchor_388"></a><a href="#footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Mr. Froude’s Editors have now taken another step in
what they consider their sacred duty to their friend who is
not dead, but sleepeth, and to the Church, by presenting the
<!--435.png--><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399"></a><span class="pageno">399</span>
Catholic reader with the second instalment of his <cite>Remains</cite>.
The contents of the present collection are, like those of the
first, very miscellaneous, and rather fragments and sketches
than complete compositions. This, of course, might be
expected in the work of a man whose days were few, and
interrupted by illness, if indeed that may be called an interruption
which, at least all the period in which the pages before us
were written, was every day sensibly drawing him to his grave.
In Mr. Froude’s case, however, we cannot set down much
of this incompleteness to the score of illness. The strength
of his religious impressions, the boldness and clearness of his
views, his long habits of self-denial, and his unconquerable
energy of mind, triumphed over weakness and decay, till men
with all their health and strength about them might gaze upon
his attenuated form, struck with a certain awe of wonderment
at the brightness of his wit, the intensenesss of his mental
vision, and the iron strength of his argument. It will perhaps
be giving a truer account of the state in which these papers
appear, to say something of the sort of intention with which
we conceive they were written. If it is permitted so to apply
the words, they were the outpourings of a soul consumed with
zeal for the house of God. The author had that in him
which he could not suppress, which of itself struggled for
utterance; he also was conscious that the night was fast
approaching in which no man can work. Yet the good work
which he believed had been prepared for him to do was
somewhat in advance of his own day; and he felt no temptation
to square, or round, and soften and disguise the awful
themes that glowed within him, till they should be perfectly
within the taste and compass of the men and times he lived
to see…. With no anxiety, then, for present effect, and no
embarrassing reference to any particular set of readers, he let
his spirit take its own free course. He only desired to spare no
labour of thought that was necessary for a thorough elucidation
of his views, to detect the lurking fallacy both in his own and
in others’ minds, and set the whole matter in the clearness of
noonday. He wrote as he thought and felt.</p>

<p>‘… We will venture a remark or two with regard to
that ironical turn which certainly does appear in various
<!--436.png--><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a><span class="pageno">400</span>
shapes in the first Part of these <cite>Remains</cite>. Unpleasant as
irony may sometimes be, there need not go with it, and in
this instance there did not go with it, the smallest real asperity
of temper. Who that remembers the inexpressible sweetness
of his smile, or the deep and melancholy pity with which he
would speak of those whom he felt to be the victims of modern
delusion, would not be forward to contradict such a suspicion?
Such expressions, we will venture to say, and not harshness,
or anger, or gloom, animate the features of that countenance
which will never cease to haunt the memory of those who
knew him. His irony arose from that peculiar mode in which
he viewed all earthly things, himself and all that was dear to
him not excepted. It was his poetry. Irony is, indeed, the
natural way in which men of high views and keen intellect
view the world: they cannot find middle terms of controversy
with men of ordinary views; they feel a gulf between them
and the world; they cannot descend to the level of lower
views, or raise others from that level to their own. As,
therefore, there is no common ground which they can seriously
or really assume with inferior and worldly minds, they fall
into a way of pretending to assume common notions, and
reasoning on them with unreal seriousness, in order to expose
them. They cannot suppress a smile at the false assumptions
and pretensions and hopes of this perishing world. The same
temper leads them to assume, for the purpose of mirth, or
argument, or self-discipline (which you please), the very worst
that the world can possibly think of themselves, their own
views and designs. Irony, in fact, seems only an ethical
expression of the logical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</i>, as applied to
matters of taste, morality, and religion. Great examples have
shown it to be compatible with real humility and wide
benevolence; though, like many other peculiarities of style,
such as depth of reflection, subtlety of reasoning, great
affectionateness, poetry, or humour, it may only be understood
by those who have something corresponding in themselves.</p>

<p>‘… As to the author now immediately before us …
while we expect certainly a great effect upon the religion of
the day from a mind so singularly gifted as his, we certainly
<!--437.png--><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401"></a><span class="pageno">401</span>
do not expect, and never have expected, a sudden and
perceptible effect. Views so bold, so original, so uncompromising
as his, seem to float upon the surface of the current
notions of the age as oil upon the waters; they seem to have
no affinity to things as they are, and to be without a medium
of acting upon them. We do not, then, look for any great
extension of Mr. Froude’s works or name for a long time;
we are prepared to think that when talked of, it will be but
objectively, as it may be called, as a phenomenon too far removed
from the speakers to interest them or affect them; as
what they have just heard of, or hardly seen. But all the while
a secret influence may be extending itself: persons may adopt
his views who are better able and willing to dilute and temper
them to the feelings of the many; the tone of religious opinion
and the standard of recognised principles may gradually be
rising; popular errors or assumptions may be silently dropped;
and numbers talk “Froudism,” as it is called, who neither know
the source of their own views, nor will credit it when taxed
with it. We are able to point at this very time to two
remarkable instances of deep thinkers, with one of whom we
have no, and with the other but faint sympathy, Bentham
and Coleridge, but whom we must still allow to be unusual
minds, the chief philosophers of their day, who yet in their
lifetime were not understood, or appreciated, and have at
length grown into celebrity, and are receiving the suitable
reward of their intellectual powers, by means of what may be
called the atmosphere of congenial thought which they have
at length formed around them. They have created the
medium in which their voices would sound, and then have
been heard far and near. A like result, in the cause of Truth,
not of worldly philosophy, we hope awaits the author of these
volumes.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_389" id="fnanchor_389"></a><a href="#footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>‘“It was at Rome that we began the <cite>Lyra Apostolica</cite>.
The motto shows the feeling of both Froude and myself at
the time. We borrowed from M. Bunsen a <cite>Homer</cite>, and
Froude chose the words in which Achilles, on returning to the
battle, says: ‘You shall know the difference, now that I am
back again.’”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_390" id="fnanchor_390"></a><a href="#footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></span> So wrote Dr. Newman in the <cite>Apologia</cite>, and
the words give exactly the note of the temper with which the
book still tingles from cover to cover. It sprang out of a
critical hour in which the force of an historical movement
first found speech. It was an hour of high passion that had
been gathering for some onset dimly foreseen, and had now,
at last, won free vent, and had flung itself out in articulate
defiance…. With the defiance, goes also a strong note of
confidence. The men who write, however dark their outlook
seems to be, speak as those who see their way, and have made
their choice, and have found their speech, and have no doubt
at all about the issue. There was a certain rapture of recklessness
about them at the time, such as belongs to young souls
who have let themselves go, under the inspiration of a high
adventure. They have burned their boats. There is no going
back. Forward all hearts are set. The opportunity is come.
It is now or never. Hurrell Froude was the embodiment to
them of this spirit of confidence, with its tinge of audacity.
He had the glow and the fascination of a man consecrated to a
cause. He wrote very little of the book, but his touch is on
it everywhere. And in a poem like “The Watchman,” with
<!--439.png--><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403"></a><span class="pageno">403</span>
its splendid swing and radiant courage, we can see how the
subtler brain of Newman was swept by the fire and force of
the man who was to him like an inspiration.</p>

<p>‘And with Froude, too, is to be associated much of the
stress laid on personal discipline which so deeply marks the
poems, and which was so congenial to both Newman and
Keble…. All the heart of the men comes out in this cry
for control, for austerity. It expressed their revolt against
the glib and shallow tolerance of the popular religion, and the
loose and boneless sentimentality of the prevailing Evangelicalism.
They were determined to show that religion was a
school of character, keen, serious, and real, which claimed not
merely the feeling or the reason, but rather the entire manhood,
so that every element and capacity were to be brought into
subjection under the law of Christ, and to be governed in subordination
to the supreme purpose of the Redemptive Will.
No labour could be too minute or too precise, which was needful
to bend the complete body of energies under the yoke of
this dedicated service. Hurrell Froude’s diary, edited by
Newman and Keble, startled the easy-going world of the
Thirties by its exhibition of the thoroughness and the rigour
and the precision with which this self-discipline had been
carried out. Such a temper of mind was, of course, capable of
<!--440.png--><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404"></a><span class="pageno">404</span>
becoming morbid, strained, unnatural. And in the hands of
smaller men, it would rapidly show traces of this. But here,
in the <cite>Lyra</cite>, it is still fresh and clean; and the men themselves
who are under its austere fascination are so abounding in
vitality, and so rich in personal distinction, and so abhorrent
of anything pedantic or conventional, that the record of it
cannot but brace us into wholesome alarm.’</p>

<p>‘Of the one hundred and seventy-nine pieces in the
collected volume [<cite>Lyra Apostolica</cite>] (and all but two of those
published in <cite>The British Magazine</cite> were reprinted), Newman
wrote one hundred and nine, Keble forty-six, Isaac Williams
nine, Hurrell Froude eight, J. W. Bowden six, and R. I.
Wilberforce one. To speak of the lesser contributions first.
Robert Wilberforce’s single contribution is not particularly
happy…. Mr. Bowden’s poems are not so infelicitous in
substance, but they leave much to desire in other ways….
The contributions of Isaac Williams consist of a few translations
and critical sonnets. Altogether of a higher stamp are
the poems by Hurrell Froude. No one could accuse that fiery
spirit of being commonplace; and perhaps because verse composition
in English was not a constant exercise with him, the few
poems he wrote for the <cite>Lyra</cite> have a free grace, as well as a lyric
intensity that removes them from the rank of the ordinary
imitations of Keble. In <abbr title="36">XXXVI</abbr>. [“Weakness of Nature”]

London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1904.</p>

<p class="center small">[By the kind permission of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Barry, and of
Messrs. Hodder &amp; Stoughton.]</p>

<p>‘Keble was an elegant scholar, from whose rarely-opened
lips pearls and diamonds of wisdom dropped, when listeners
were congenial; he could not brook, as he did not understand,
variety of opinions; and charming as he proved to all
who would not contradict him, none was constitutionally less
fitted to be at the head of a great party. His genius had
in it no elements deserving the name of original thought.
Rather did he serve Newman as the living embodiment of
institutions now deemed Apostolic, and, so to speak, himself a
present antiquity. He possessed none of those gifts which
strike and subdue the unconverted. Hurrell Froude, the “bright
and beautiful,” cut off in the midst of his days, was another
sort of man. “He went forward,” says his brother Anthony,
“taking the fences as they came, passing lightly over them all,
and sweeping his friends along with them. He had the contempt
<!--442.png--><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406"></a><span class="pageno">406</span>
of an intellectual aristocrat for private judgment.”
This, which sounds like a bull, but is only a paradox, was
equally applicable to Newman, despite his infinite consideration
for persons as they came before him. The Many could
be neither wise nor right, except when they listened to the Few
who were both. It was Froude that made Newman and
Keble really known to each other: he boasted of it as the one
good thing he had ever done. It was certainly the most
important. “You and Keble are the philosophers, and I the
rhetorician,” wrote the Vicar of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary’s to him in 1836.
There was so much of a foundation in the contrast that
Newman did always look to Froude as a standard, a test, and
a light by which to judge of his own utterances…. But
[Froude] disclaimed being original as other men have prided
themselves upon it. Thoughts and speculations, nevertheless,
were his daily bread…. Alone among Newman’s correspondents,
he writes as his born equal, criticising freely, breaking
out into the genial humour, so fresh and unconstrained, which
lights up this all too serious intercourse of country parsons,
London dignitaries, and unfledged Oxford dons.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>‘When preaching on the Greatness and Littleness of Human
Life, [Newman] refers secretly to this lofty spirit as among
the men who, “by such passing flashes, like rays of the sun,
and the darting lightning, give tokens of their immortality,
… that they are but angels in disguise.”’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_391" id="fnanchor_391"></a><a href="#footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>‘The volumes themselves [the <cite>Remains</cite>] are highly valuable
to every practical student of the human character, because they
exhibit an individual in his true colours, and afford evidences of
what the human mind (even with all the advantages of natural

the Light which is from above. They cannot but fill the heart
of every true Christian with horror, and his eye with tears, when
the reflection crosses the mind that views like these are held up
as a religion of a meek and lowly Saviour, and that an influence
such as that exerted over the wretched object of these memoirs
should be permitted to draw away any poor sinner from that
open Fountain of purity and holiness which is filled with joy,
peace, and love, for all that humbly visit it. There are from
time to time a few gleams of light faintly discernible amidst

<p>‘Hurrell Froude passed away so early in the work of the
Movement, and could work so little for it, that his actual share
in it needs to be sought out through contemporary records.
Little as his pen did, short as his life was, those who can recall
the time feel the influence of his mere presence to have been
essential to the original impulse which set all going. They
cannot imagine the start without his forwarding, impelling look
and voice. His presence impressed persons as a spiritual,
though living, influence. He stands distinct, apart, in the
memory of those who can recall it, the more that years<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_393" id="fnanchor_393"></a><a href="#footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></span> do

Perhaps we ought to name a fourth, Hurrell Froude: but he
lives in Newman. He was the swiftest, most daring spirit of
them all; his thought is hot, as it were, with the fever that
shortened his days; his words are suffused as with a hectic

gathered from his books. He reminds me of Pascal: his unflinchingness, his
humour, his hatred of humbug, his mathematical genius (architecture, and the French-<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">révolutionnaire</i>),
his imagination, his merciless self-discipline. I should like to

<p class="footnote">‘[Hurrell Froude] was anything but “learned.” In lecture he gave you the idea
of not being, in knowledge, so very much in advance of those whom he taught; but
he had a fine taste, a quick and piercing precision of thought, a fertility and depth of
reasoning, which stimulated a mind which had any quickness and activity. He had
an interest in everything; he would draw with you, sail on the river with you, talk
philosophy or politics with you, ride over fences with you, skate with you: all with
a kind of joyous enjoyment. Mischief seems to have been his snare as a boy, and a
controlled delight in what was on the edge of mischief gave a kind of verve to his
character as a man. This made him charming to those whom he liked. But then
he did not choose to like any whom he did not respect; and he could be as hard
and sharp as you please on what he thought bad, [<i>i.e.</i>,] profane, vicious, or coxcombical.’</p>

 [I find that John Keble and others quite agree with me that there was
that in Hurrell Froude that he could not have joined the Church of Rome.]
There is a somewhat corroborative passage in <cite>A Short Sketch of the Tractarian
Upheaval</cite>, by Thomas Leach, B.A. London: Bemrose &amp; Sons, 1887. ‘It is
possible, of course, as Dr. Newman would seem to imply, that Froude would have
gone over side by side, or rather in advance of, his fellow-leader: for Froude was
one to be in advance generally of those with whom he journeyed. On the other
hand, we must give due weight to the fact that Froude, as Dr. Newman himself tells
us, was “an Englishman to the backbone in his severe adherence to the real and
the concrete.”’ The inference, pleasing to some minds, is that ‘Rome’ is a mere
chimera.</p>

 The lines occur in the section of the book called ‘The Side of the Hill.’
The needlessly prosy narrative is mainly an amplification of a statement already
quoted from the <cite>Autobiography</cite>, and is included here purely because of the subject-matter,
and not because it can in any degree represent with truth one of the most
charming poets of his generation.</p>

 To Mr. Keble. ‘I cannot in fairness withdraw specimens such as these of the
view taken by my very dear friend of Italy and its religion, though, of course, I
leave them in the text with much pain. He was a man who did nothing by halves.
He had cherished an ideal of the Holy See and the Church of Rome partly erroneous,
partly unreal, and was greatly disappointed when, to his apprehension, it was not
fulfilled. He had expected to find a state of lofty sanctity in Italian Catholics,
which, he considered, was not only not exemplified, but was even contradicted, in
what he saw and heard of them. As to the Tridentine definitions, he simply looked
at them as obstacles to the union of Anglicans with the See of Rome, not having the
theological knowledge necessary for a judgement on their worth.’ Note to a Letter

 Note by Cardinal Wiseman, 1853, in reprinting, after fourteen years, his
review of Froude’s <cite>Remains in Essays on Various Subjects</cite>, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr>, 93. ‘[It] remains
marked, with gratitude, in my mind, as an epoch in my life,&mdash;the visit which Mr.
Froude unexpectedly paid me, [at the English College, Rome, March, 1833], in
company with one [J. H. N.] who never afterwards departed from my thoughts….
From that hour I watched with intense interest and love the Movement of which I
then caught the first glimpse. My studies changed their course, the bent of my mind
was altered, in the strong desire to co-operate in the new mercies of Providence.’
In 1841, he had written to Phillipps de Lisle: ‘Let us have an influx of new blood,
let us have but even a small number of such men as write in the <cite>Tracts</cite>, so imbued
with the spirit of the early Church: men who have learned to teach from Saint
Augustine, to preach from Saint Chrysostom, and to feel from Saint Bernard;&mdash;let
even a few such men, with the high clerical feeling which I believe them to possess,
enter fully into the spirit of the Catholic religion, and <em>we</em> shall be speedily reformed,
and England quickly converted…. It is not to you that I say this for the first
time, for I have long said it to those about me, that if the Oxford divines enter the
Church, we must be ready to fall into the shade, and take up our position in
the background. I will gladly say to any of them: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">me oportet minui</i>…. Their
might, in His, would be irresistible. Abuses would soon give way before our united
efforts, and many things which appear such to them would perhaps be explained.’
The writer’s ‘intense interest and love’ for the Movement never changed. <cite>Life and

by Mr. J. A. Froude to <cite>The Nineteenth Century</cite>, <abbr title="volume one">vol. i.</abbr> It was entitled ‘Life

 Archdeacon Froude to Sir J. Coleridge, March 26, 1838: ‘Neither abroad
nor at home, did I ever know [Hurrell] to be the apologist of the Papal Church,
much less hold it up to approbation, except for its zeal and unity…. In our
own, Bishop Bull and the Nonjurors were, I think, the patterns he proposed to
himself for everything that was noble and disinterested in temporal, and sound in
doctrinal matters. But I feel I am quite unable to explain or defend the notions
he had formed on these important subjects.’ <cite>Memoir of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Keble, <abbr title="Master of Arts">M.A.</abbr>,

 The preference for the style of the Italian Renaissance came to be shared by
other faithless Oxonians, as all the world knows, particularly, for practical reasons,
by Newman, Faber, and the whole English Oratorian group. It must seem a distinct
note of impending degeneracy in Froude, to those who have the heart to
distrust him.</p>

 The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> James Bowling Mozley had this criticism to make on his brother’s
article quoted above: ‘It gives too much the impression of Froude as a philosopher
simply, instead of one who was constantly bringing his general maxims to bear,
most forcibly and pointedly, on the present state of things; on particular classes,
sects, and parties. It does not bring out Froude’s great, practical, and almost
lawyer-like penetration.’ <cite>Letters of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> J. B. Mozley</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 102.</p>

Christian” is a powerful book; that it is one

is a beautiful figure, fit to stand beside the
good Bishop in “Les Misérables.” It is a
book with a serious purpose expressed with
absolute unconventionality and passion….
And this is to say it is a book worth reading.’&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
